# Project Outline

## Brief project outline
* The task in hand is to create a UI which provides a search bar to take user input, alongwith some filters.
* Then for a particular input extract citations from ACM,IEEE,Springer and Science direct
* Remove duplicates from the search result and create a file out of it.

## Solution Approach
* Firstly a simple UI is to be created using HTML,CSS.
* Web scraping will be required for which python's BeautifulSoup library could be used to extract results from ACM,IEEE etc.
* Lastly, save the results in a file.

## System Requirements
* Modern web browser for the UI
* And system with installed python.

## Constraints
* As of now, no resource constraints are there.

## Timeline
* The whole project could be broken down into sub-activities as follows:
* Analyzing various citations platforms, their filters and all.
* Creating Web page for the UI.
* Backend part, creating python scripts to extract the data.
* Figuring out some approach to remove duplicates.
* Validating the results.
