# Project Outline

## Brief project outline
* The task in hand is to create a UI which provides a basic search (search bar to take user input) and advanced search (to add more filters).
* Then for a particular search input extract citations from ACM, IEEE, Springer and Science direct
* Remove duplicates from the search result and create a json file and let the user download it.

## Solution Approach
* Web scraping will be required for which python's BeautifulSoup library could be used to extract results from ACM,IEEE etc.
* Analyzing various libraries for their filters(basic and advanced search).
* A simple UI is to be created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript where user can download the results.
* Generating search string url for every library based on the user input.
* Combining the results from the 4 libraries and removing duplicates.
* Integrating frontend and backend.
* Hosting the website.

## System Requirements
* Modern web browser for the UI.
* And system with installed python.

## Constraints
* As of now, no resource constraints are there.

## Timeline
* The whole project could be broken down into sub-activities as follows:
* Phase 1 -- 17-10-2020 : 
    Backend part, creating python scripts to extract the data for each library. 
* Phase 2 -- 30-10-2020 : 
    Analyzing various citations platforms, their filters and all.
* Phase 3 -- 10-11-2020 : 
    Extract results for IEEE.
    Creating Web page for the UI. 
    Generating search string url for every library based on the user input.
    Combining the results and removing duplicates.
    Integrating frontend and backend.
    Hosting the website.
* Phase 4 -- Validating the results.
