Fixing defects in such programs takes much human effort due to the interplay between imperative code and database-centric logic. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for automated fixing of bugs in the selection condition of database statements (e.g., WHERE clause of SELECT statements) \u2013 a common form of bugs in such programs. Our key observation is that in real-world data, there is information latent in the distribution of data that can be useful to repair selection conditions efficiently. Given a faulty database program and input data, only a part of which induces the defect, our novelty is in determining the correct behavior for the defect-inducing data by taking advantage of the information revealed by the rest of the data. We accomplish this by employing semi-supervised learning to predict the correct behavior for defect-inducing data and by patching up any inaccuracies in the prediction by a SAT-based combinatorial search. Next, we learn a compact decision tree for the correct behavior, including the correct behavior on the defect-inducing data. This tree suggests a plausible fix to the selection condition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on seven realworld examples.

In this paper, we propose to present a data-driven computational framework to evaluate the energy impact on the transportation system at different scales, leveraging the scalable high-performance transportation simulator, Mobiliti. Instead of using empirical energy models, we create a deep-neural-network mapping between the fuel and energy consumption rate with a variety of heterogeneous driving conditions based on dynamometer test datasets, real-world drive cycle survey datasets as well as real-world GPS probe datasets. For the dynamic driving behaviors, machine learning algorithms are applied over the real-world drive cycle datasets to identify the dominant features and to cluster the drive cycles into representative groups, which can be used to generate high-resolution random drive cycles using a Markov chain approach. Using Mobiliti, both urban-scale static evaluations and dynamic analysis at the trip level can be estimated with a significantly improved fidelity.

This is particularly relevant in the embedded domain, where the security solution should be customized to the needs of the target system, while considering other design objectives such as cost, performance, and power. Due to the increasing complexity and shrinking design cycles of embedded software, most embedded systems present a host of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited by security attacks. Many attacks are initiated by causing a violation in the properties of data ( e.g., integrity, privacy, access control rules, etc.) associated with a \"trusted\" program that is executing on the system, leading to a range of undesirable effects.In this work, we develop a general framework that provides security assurance against a wide class of security attacks. Our work is based on the observation that a program's permissible behaviorwith respect to data accesses can be characterized by certain properties. We present a hardware/software approach wherein such properties can be encoded as data attributes and enforced as security policies during program execution. These policies may be application-specific (e.g., access control for certain data structures), compiler-generated (e.g., enforcing that variables are accessed only within their scope), or universally applicable to all programs (e.g., disallowing writes to unallocated memory). We show how an embedded system architecture can support such policies by (i) enhancing the memory hierarchy to represent the attributes of each datum as security tags that are linked to it through its lifetime, and (ii) adding a configurable hardware checker that interprets the semantics of the tags and enforces the desired security policies. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in enforcing various security policies for several embedded benchmarks.

This is particularly challenging when users can modify data in arbitrary ways, they employ multiple cloud services, and cloud services cannot be changed.To track the propagation of text data robustly across cloud services, we introduce imprecise data flow tracking, which identifies data flows implicitly by detecting and quantifying the similarity between text fragments. To reason about violations of data disclosure policies, we describe a new text disclosure model that, based on similarity, associates text fragments in web browsers with security tags and identifies unauthorised data flows to untrusted services. We demonstrate the applicability of imprecise data tracking through BrowserFlow, a browser-based middleware that alerts users when they expose potentially sensitive text to an untrusted cloud service.

Commuters have to wait long hours for arrival of buses, and when the bus arrives it is often found to be overcrowded, causing inconvenience in the commuters and discouraging them to use public transit system. The ITS(Intelligent Transport System) developed so far does provide arrival time of buses in real time but such systems are rare which provide the passenger occupancy in real time. Most of such installations use extortionate devices like passenger counting devices, cameras etc installed on the buses and at the bus stops. In this paper we propose a cost effective user participation based mode of collecting information about occupancy level of public transportation system using the potential of smartphones. Smartphones have inbuilt sensors like GPS which can be used to extract locational intelligence of the commuters. Hence, information gets crowdsourced from commuters and they themselves can provide information about occupancy level of a bus using their smartphones. The information so collected is stored in a historical database which is analyzed and processed to obtain occupancy level patterns for different routes on different days. The patterns observed are used to make predictions of occupancy level in a bus.

Healthcare IoT can thus reduce a lot of overhead while allowing people to access healthcare services all the time and everywhere. However, healthcare IoT exchanges data over the IP-centric Internet which has vulnerabilities related to security, privacy, and mobility. Those features are added to the Internet as external add-ons.

Despite a provider's best efforts, accidental data leakage may occur due to misconfigurations or bugs in the cloud platform. Especially in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds, which rely on weaker forms of isolation, the potential for unnoticed data leakage is high. Prior work to raise tenants' trust in clouds relies on attestation, which limits the management flexibility of providers, or fine-grained data tracking, which has high overheads.We describe CloudSafetyNet (CSN), a lightweight monitoring framework that gives tenants visibility into the propagation of their application data in a cloud environment with low performance overhead. It exploits the incentive of tenants to co-operate with each other to detect accidental data leakage. CSN transparently adds opaque security tags to a subset of form fields in HTTP requests, using a client-side JavaScript library. Socket-level monitors maintain a log of observed tags flowing between application components. Tenants retrieve their logs and identify foreign tags that indicate data leakage. To check the correct operation of CSN, tenants send probe requests with known tags and verify that monitors are logging correctly. Using an implementation of CSN deployed on the OpenShift and AppScale PaaS platforms, we show that it can discover misconfigurations and bugs with a negligible performance impact.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 6th edition of the ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security", "pages": "117-128", "numpages": "12", "keywords": "socket-level monitoring, inter-tenant isolation, data leakage detection, cloud", "location": "Scottsdale, Arizona, USA", "series": "CCSW '14"}, {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Muthukumaran, Divya and O'Keeffe, Dan and Priebe, Christian and Eyers, David and Shand, Brian and Pietzuch, Peter", "title": "FlowWatcher: Defending against Data Disclosure Vulnerabilities in Web Applications", "year": 2015, "isbn": "9781450338325", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813639", "doi": "10.1145/2810103.2813639", "abstract": "Bugs in the authorisation logic of web applications can expose the data of one user to another.

The UDA policy states the intended data ownership and how it changes based on observed HTTP requests. FlowWatcher detects violations of the UDA policy by tracking data items that are likely to be unique across HTTP requests and responses of different users.

Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1)~Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2)~Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation under the Smallbank benchmark as well as under a custom workload shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 12x, while decreasing the average latency to almost half.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data", "pages": "105-122", "numpages": "18", "keywords": "hyperledger, information systems, blockchain, distributed systems, concurrenct control, fabric, distributed ledger, ledger, transactions", "location": "Amsterdam, Netherlands", "series": "SIGMOD '19"}, {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Padmanabhan, Divya", "title": "Theoretical Models for Learning from Multiple, Heterogenous and Strategic Agents", "year": 2017, "publisher": "International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems", "address": "Richland, SC", "doi": "10.5555/3091125.3091466", "abstract": "With the advent of internet enabled hand-held mobile devices, there is a proliferation of user generated data.

This happens because the existing mechanisms consider the worst case scenario where the means of the agents' stochastic rewards are separated by a very small amount that depends on T. We make, and, exploit the crucial observation that in most scenarios, the separation between the agents' rewards is rarely a function of T. Moreover, in the case that the rewards of the arms are arbitrarily close, the regret contributed by such sub-optimal arms is minimal. Our idea is to allow the center to indicate the resolution, \u0394, with which the agents must be distinguished. This immediately leads us to introduce the notion of \u0394-Regret. Using sponsored search auctions as a concrete example (the same idea applies for other applications as well), we propose a dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and individually rational (IR), deterministic MAB mechanism, based on ideas from the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) family of MAB algorithms.

It promotes low data access latency, high bandwidth, massive parallelism, and low power consumption. The skyline operator is a known primitive used to identify those multi-dimensional points offering optimal trade-offs within a given dataset. For large multidimensional dataset, calculating the skyline is extensively compute and data intensive. Although, PIM systems present opportunities to mitigate this cost, their execution model relies on all processors operating in isolation with minimal data exchange. This prohibits direct application of known skyline optimizations which are inherently sequential, creating dependencies and large intermediate results that limit the maximum parallelism, throughput, and require an expensive merging phase.In this work, we address these challenges by introducing the first skyline algorithm for PIM architectures, called DSky. It is designed to be massively parallel and throughput efficient by leveraging a novel work assignment strategy that emphasizes load balancing. Our experiments demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for CPUs and GPUs, in most cases. DSky achieves 2\u00d7 to 14\u00d7 higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art solutions on competing CPU and GPU architectures. Furthermore, we showcase DSky's good scaling properties which are intertwined with PIM's ability to allocate resources with minimal added cost.

To achieve true autonomy, robots need to continuously process and interact with their environment through computationally-intensive motion planning and control algorithms under a low power budget. Specialized architectures offer a potent choice to provide low-power, high-performance accelerators for these algorithms. Instead of taking a traditional route which profiles and maps hot code regions to accelerators, this paper delves into the algorithmic characteristics of the application domain. We observe that many motion planning and control algorithms are formulated as a constrained optimization problems solved online through Model Predictive Control (MPC). While models and objective functions differ between robotic systems and tasks, the structure of the optimization problem and solver remain fixed. Using this theoretical insight, we create RoboX, an end-to-end solution which exposes a high-level domain-specific language to roboticists. This interface allows roboticists to express the physics of the robot and its task in a form close to its concise mathematical expressions. The RoboX backend then automatically maps this high-level specification to a novel programmable architecture, which harbors a programmable memory access engine and compute-enabled interconnects.

However, such an integration introduces severe security risks to the vehicle. The in-vehicle network was originally designed to operate in a closed environment and thus, security was not of concern. It has now become an important issue due to an increasing number of external interfaces to the in-vehicle network. Several studies have already shown that an in-vehicle network can be easily compromised just by connecting cheap commercial devices and doing reverse engineering. Although research efforts have been made to secure in-vehicle networks, most of them focused on defining security requirements, or presenting attack scenarios without providing any feasible solution. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any study with a specific focus on understanding and analyzing the security aspects of integrating mobile devices with cars.

It is the compiler's responsibility to fit programs into pipeline resources. However, switch compilers, which use rewrite rules to generate switch machine code, often reject programs because the rules fail to transform programs into a form that can be mapped to a pipeline's limited resources---even if a mapping actually exists.This paper presents a compiler, Chipmunk, which formulates code generation as a program synthesis problem. Chipmunk uses a program synthesis engine, SKETCH, to transform high-level programs down to switch machine code. However, naively formulating code generation as program synthesis can lead to long compile times. Hence, we develop a new domain-specific synthesis technique, slicing, which reduces compile times by 1-387x and 51x on average.Using a switch hardware simulator, we show that Chipmunk compiles many programs that a previous rule-based compiler, Domino, rejects. Chipmunk also produces machine code with fewer pipeline stages than Domino. A Chipmunk backend for the Tofino programmable switch shows that program synthesis can produce machine code for high-speed switches.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Annual conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication", "pages": "44-61", "numpages": "18", "keywords": "Programmable switches, slicing, program synthesis, packet processing pipelines, code generation", "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '20"}, {"type": "article", "author": "Malhotra, Ruchika and Tiwari, Divya", "title": "Development of a framework for test case prioritization using genetic algorithm", "year": 2013, "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2464526.2464536", "doi": "10.1145/2464526.2464536", "abstract": "Software Testing is a time and effort consuming part of the software development life cycle.

Although this architecture provides more flexibility for the running application to determine the optimal run-time settings that maximize energy-efficiency, due to the interdependence of various tuning parameters such as the type of core, run-time voltage and frequency, and the number of threads, the scheduling becomes more challenging. More importantly, the impact of Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of the On-Chip Voltage Regulators (OCVRs) is another important parameter that makes it more challenging to schedule multithreaded applications on HMPs. In this paper, the importance of concurrent optimization and fine-tuning of the circuit and architectural parameters for energy-efficient scheduling on HMPs is addressed to harness the power of heterogeneity. In addition, the scheduling challenges for multithreaded applications are investigated for HMP architectures that account for the impact of power conversion efficiency. A highly accurate learning-based model is developed for energy-efficiency prediction to guide the scheduling decision. Using the predictive model, we further develop a PCE-aware scheduling scheme is developed for effective mapping of multithreaded applications onto an HMP.

Approximation is useful only if its impact on application output quality is acceptable to the users. However, there is a lack of systematic solutions and studies that explore users' perspective on the effects of approximation. In this paper, we seek to provide one such solution for the developers to probe and discover the boundary of quality loss that most users will deem acceptable. We propose AxGames, a crowdsourced solution that enables developers to readily infer a statistical common ground from the general public through three entertaining games. The users engage in these games by betting on their opinion about the quality loss of the final output while the AxGames framework collects statistics about their perceptions. The framework then statistically analyzes the results to determine the acceptable levels of quality for a pair of (application, approximation technique). The three games are designed such that they effectively capture quality requirements with various tradeoffs and contexts. To evaluate AxGames, we examine seven diverse applications that produce user perceptible outputs and cover a wide range of domains, including image processing, optical character recognition, speech to text conversion, and audio processing. We recruit 700 participants/users through Amazon's Mechanical Turk to play the games that collect statistics about their perception on different levels of quality. Subsequently, the AxGames framework uses the Clopper-Pearson exact method, which computes a binomial proportion confidence interval, to analyze the collected statistics for each level of quality. Using this analysis, AxGames can statistically project the quality level that satisfies a given percentage of users. The developers can use these statistical projections to tune the level of approximation based on the user experience. We find that the level of acceptable quality loss significantly varies across applications. For instance, to satisfy 90% of users, the level of acceptable quality loss is 2% for one application (image processing) and 26% for another (audio processing). Moreover, the pattern with which the crowd responds to approximation takes significantly different shape and form depending on the class of applications.

Recent years have seen many automated localization techniques, specifically using the program\u2019s passing and failing test runs, i.e., test spectra. However, the effectiveness of these approaches is sensitive to factors such as the type and number of faults, and the quality of the test-suite. This paper presents a novel technique that applies spectra-based localization in synergy with specification-based analysis to more accurately locate faults. Our insight is that unsatisfiability analysis of violated specifications, enabled by SAT technology, could be used to (1) compute unsatisfiable cores that contain likely faulty statements and (2) generate tests that help spectra-based localization. Our technique is iterative and driven by a feedback loop that enables more precise fault localization. SAT-TAR is a framework that embodies our technique for Java programs, including those with multiple faults. An experimental evaluation using a suite of widely-studied data structure programs, including the ANTLR and JTopas parser applications, shows that our technique localizes faults more accurately than state-of-the-art approaches.

Specifically, we extract properties of an embedded program through static program analysis, and use them as the bases for enforcing permissible program behavior in real-time as the program executes. We present an architecture for hardware-assisted run-time monitoring, wherein the embedded processor is augmented with a hardware monitor that observes the processor's dynamic execution trace, checks whether the execution trace falls within the allowed program behavior, and flags any deviations from the expected behavior to trigger appropriate response mechanisms. We present properties that can be used to capture permissible program behavior at different levels of granularity within a program, namely inter-procedural control flow, intra-procedural control flow, and instruction stream integrity. We also present a systematic methodology to design application-specific hardware monitors for any given embedded program.

A big fraction of these cabs are managed by web-based cab operators, who provide the service to commuters through a mobile application. Sometimes, the drivers of these cabs swindle the customers by over-charging them for the journey. This happens when the cab drivers start the billing process before the commuter boards the cab and/or, when they end the billing process much later than when the commuter has deboarded the cab. Such cases can be prevented by detecting and recording the actual boarding and deboarding time of the commuter. Our proposed system handles such cases of fraud, by detecting the boarding and deboarding events of commuter in the cab. It suggests to do so by using the pressure values recorded by the barometer sensor of the smartphone of the commuter, and of a barometer device installed in the cab or using the barometer sensor of smartphone of the cab driver. The core of our mechanism is a comparison of the sequence of barometer values across two devices: the commuter's and the driver's.

We developed a mobile application for Veterinarians and livestock Artificial Insemination Technicians (AIT) to collect and monitor livestock data and images throughout their pregnancy lifecycle.

DL models revealed the poor quality of the images, such as missing livestock as well as noisy and blurred images. Model accuracy decreased due to this. To address this challenge DL were methods to analyze the image, train system and generated an AIT Image Score (AIS) based on factors like quantity of images, accuracy of images, frequency of upload, geo-location etc. Based on AIS, we created a personalized feedback message and training instructions on how to click and collect images for each AIT.

In a rather disjoint effort, the community is focusing mostly on high performance single-node accelerators for learning. This work bridges these two paradigms and offers CoSMIC, a full computing stack constituting language, compiler, system software, template architecture, and circuit generators, that enable programmable acceleration of learning at scale. CoSMIC enables programmers to exploit scale-out acceleration using FPGAs and Programmable ASICs (P-ASICs) from a high-level and mathematical Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Nonetheless, CoSMIC does not require programmers to delve into the onerous task of system software development or hardware design. CoSMIC achieves three conflicting objectives of efficiency, automation, and programmability, by integrating a novel multi-threaded template accelerator architecture and a cohesive stack that generates the hardware and software code from its high-level DSL. CoSMIC can accelerate a wide range of learning algorithms that are most commonly trained using parallel variants of gradient descent. The key is to distribute partial gradient calculations of the learning algorithms across the accelerator-augmented nodes of the scale-out system. Additionally, CoSMIC leverages the parallelizability of the algorithms to offer multi-threaded acceleration within each node. Multi-threading allows CoSMIC to efficiently exploit the numerous resources that are becoming available on modern FPGAs/P-ASICs by striking a balance between multi-threaded parallelism and single-threaded performance. CoSMIC takes advantage of algorithmic properties of ML to offer a specialized system software that optimizes task allocation, role-assignment, thread management, and internode communication. We evaluate the versatility and efficiency of CoSMIC for 10 different machine learning applications from various domains. On average, a 16-node CoSMIC with UltraScale+ FPGAs offers 18.8\u00d7 speedup over a 16-node Spark system with Xeon processors while the programmer only writes 22--55 lines of code. CoSMIC offers higher scalability compared to the state-of-the-art Spark; scaling from 4 to 16 nodes with CoSMIC yields 2.7\u00d7 improvements whereas Spark offers 1.8\u00d7.

This paper evaluates a flexible architectural approach, called Composable Lightweight Processors (or CLPs), that allows simple, low-power cores to be aggre- gated together dynamically, forming larger, more powerful single-threaded processors without changing the applica- tion binary. We evaluate one such design with 32 cores called TFlex, which can be configured as 32 dual-issue pro- cessors, or as a single 64-wide issue processor, or as any point in between.

Thirdly, it ascertains the right way for evaluation by analyzing dependency between the service logics through FSM.

Due to the burgeoning growth in Internet applications, multiple application queries can exhibit overlapping in their functional requirements, such as the region of interest, sensing attributes, and sensing time duration. This overlapping results in redundant sensing tasks generation leading to the increased overall network traffic and energy consumption. Existing approaches operate on data sharing among various tasks to minimize the upstream traffic. However, no existing work attempts to prevent the redundant task generation to reduce the downstream traffic. Moreover, the allocation of suitable sensor nodes to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the queries is still an open issue. This article proposes an end-to-end query processing framework (named, QueryPM) that first, calculates the functional requirements similarity among queries to prevent the redundant task generation.

While several commodity systems now include mandatory access control (MAC) enforcement to protect the individual components, the complexity of such MAC policies and the myriad of possible interactions among individual hosts in distributed systems makes it difficult to identify the attack paths available to adversaries. As a result, security practitioners react to vulnerabilities as adversaries uncover them, rather than proactively protecting the system's data integrity. In this paper, we develop a mostly-automated method to transform a set of commodity MAC policies into a system-wide policy that proactively protects system integrity, approximating the Clark-Wilson integrity model. The method uses the insights from the Clark-Wilson model, which requires integrity verification of security-critical data and mediation at program entrypoints, to extend existing MAC policies with the proactive mediation necessary to protect system integrity. We demonstrate the practicality of producing Clark-Wilson policies for distributed systems on a web application running on virtualized Ubuntu SELinux hosts, where our method finds: (1) that only 27 additional entrypoint mediators are sufficient to mediate the threats of remote adversaries over the entire distributed system and (2) and only 20 additional local threats require mediation to approximate Clark-Wilson integrity comprehensively. As a result, available security policies can be used as a foundation for proactive integrity protection from both local and remote threats.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 28th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference", "pages": "269-278", "numpages": "10", "location": "Orlando, Florida, USA", "series": "ACSAC '12"}, {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Muthukumaran, Divya and Sawani, Anuj and Schiffman, Joshua and Jung, Brian M. and Jaeger, Trent", "title": "Measuring integrity on mobile phone systems", "year": 2008, "isbn": "9781605581293", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/1377836.1377862", "doi": "10.1145/1377836.1377862", "abstract": "Mobile phone security is a relatively new field that is gathering momentum in the wake of rapid advancements in phone system technology. Mobile phones are now becoming sophisticated smart phones that provide services beyond basic telephony, such as supporting third-party applications. Such third-party applications may be security-critical, such as mobile banking, or may be untrusted applications, such as downloaded games. Our goal is to protect the integrity of such critical applications from potentially untrusted functionality, but we find that existing mandatory access control approaches are too complex and do not provide formal integrity guarantees. In this work, we leverage the simplicity inherent to phone system environments to develop a compact SELinux policy that can be used to justify the integrity of a phone system using the Policy Reduced Integrity Measurement Architecture (PRIMA) approach. We show that the resultant policy enables systems to be proven secure to remote parties, enables the desired functionality for installing and running trusted programs, and the resultant SELinux policy is over 90% smaller in size.

A major portion of known security attacks against software systems can be attributed to this shortcoming, including the well-known stack overflow, heap overflow, and format string attacks. Despite their limitations, the flexibility, performance, and ease of use of these languages have made them the choice of most embedded software developers. Researchers have proposed various techniques to enhance programs for memory safety; however, they are all subject to severe performance penalties, making their use impractical in most scenarios. In this paper, we present architectural enhancements to enable efficient, memory-safe execution of software on embedded processors. The key insight behind our approach is to extend embedded processors with hardware that significantly accelerates the execution of the additional computations involved in memory-safe execution. Specifically, we design custom instructions to perform various kinds of memory-safety checks and augment the instruction set of a state-of-the-art extensible processor (Xtensa from Tensilica, Inc.) to implement them. We demonstrate the application of the proposed architectural enhancements using CCured, an existing tool for type-safe retrofitting of C programs. The tool uses a type-inferencing engine that is built around strong type-safety theory and is provably safe. Simulations of memory-safe versions of popular embedded benchmarks on a cycle-accurate simulator modeling a typical embedded system configuration indicate an average performance improvement of 2.3x, and a maximum of 4.6x when using the proposed architecture. These enhancements entail minimal (less than 10%) hardware overhead to the base processor.

However, there is a vast decision space in which each invocation can either be delegated to the accelerator---improving performance and efficiency--or run on the precise core---maintaining quality. In this paper we introduce Mithra, a co-designed hardware-software solution, that navigates these tradeoffs to deliver high performance and efficiency while lowering the final quality loss. Mithra seeks to identify whether each individual accelerator invocation will lead to an undesirable quality loss and, if so, directs the processor to run the original precise code.This identification is cast as a binary classification task that requires a cohesive co-design of hardware and software. The hardware component performs the classification at runtime and exposes a knob to the software mechanism to control quality tradeoffs. The software tunes this knob by solving a statistical optimization problem that maximizes benefits from approximation while providing statistical guarantees that final quality level will be met with high confidence. The software uses this knob to tune and train the hardware classifiers. We devise two distinct hardware classifiers, one table-based and one neural network based. To understand the efficacy of these mechanisms, we compare them with an ideal, but infeasible design, the oracle. Results show that, with 95% confidence the table-based design can restrict the final output quality loss to 5% for 90% of unseen input sets while providing 2.5\u00d7 speedup and 2.6\u00d7 energy efficiency. The neural design shows similar speedup however, improves the efficiency by 13%. Compared to the table-based design, the oracle improves speedup by 26% and efficiency by 36%.

Determining the routes that lead to the traffic congestion segment is also vital in devising mitigation strategies. Further, crowdsourcing this information allows for use of these strategies quickly and in places where infrastructure is not available. In this work, we present an unconventional method, using the barometer sensor of mobile phones to (a) detect road traffic congestion and (b) estimate the paths that lead to the congested road segment. We make the observation that roads are not completely flat and very often, altitude varies along the road. The barometer sensor chips are sensitive enough to measure these variations and consume very little energy of the mobile phone, compared to other sensors such as the GPS or accelerometer. We devise a feature set to map the rate of change of this altitude as the user moves into activities characterized as \u201cstill\u201d and \u201cmotion,\u201d which are further used by the traffic congestion detection algorithm (RoadSphygmo) to classify the group of users as being in \u201cmoving,\u201d \u201ccongestion,\u201d &nbsp;or \u201cstuck\u201d states. To estimate the paths that lead to the congested road segment, we compare the user\u2019s barometer sensor readings with a pre-stored road signature of barometer values using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We show that by using correlation of barometer sensor values, we can determine if users are in the same vehicle. We crowdsource this information from multiple mobile phones and use majority voting technique to improve the accuracy of traffic congestion detection and path estimation. We find a significant increase in the accuracies using crowdsourced information as compared to individual mobile phones. Further, we show that we can use barometer sensor for other applications such as bus occupancy, boarding/deboarding of a vehicle, and so on. The validation of the state determined by RoadSphygmo is done by comparing it with average GPS speed calculated during the same time period.

However, the demands of personalization stand unfulfilled by current agent training paradigms such as machine learning, which require many orders of data to train agents on a single task. In sequential decision making domains, Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables this need, when a priori training of desired behaviors is intractable. Prior work has leveraged user input to train agents by mapping them to numerical reward signals. However, recent approaches have identified inconsistent human feedback as a bottleneck to achieving best-case performance. In this work, we present empirical evidence to show that human perception affected by contrast effects distorts their feedback to Reinforcement Learning agents. Through a set of studies involving 900 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were asked to give feedback to RL agents, we show that participants significantly underrate an agent's actions after being exposed to an agent of higher competence on the same task. To understand the significance of this effect on agent performance during training, we then simulate trainers that underrate actions of an agent based on past performance - creating a systematically skewed feedback signal - integrated into an actor-critic framework. Our results show that agent performance is reduced by up to 98% in the presence of systematic skews in human feedback in Atari environments.

FPGAs are an attractive choice for DNNs since they offer a programmable substrate for acceleration and are becoming available across different market segments. However, obtaining both performance and energy efficiency with FPGAs is a laborious task even for expert hardware designers. Furthermore, the large memory footprint of DNNs, coupled with the FPGAs' limited on-chip storage makes DNN acceleration using FPGAs more challenging. This work tackles these challenges by devising DnnWeaver, a framework that automatically generates a synthesizable accelerator for a given (DNN, FPGA) pair from a high-level specification in Caffe [1]. To achieve large benefits while preserving automation, DnnWeaver generates accelerators using hand-optimized design templates. First, DnnWeaver translates a given high-level DNN specification to its novel ISA that represents a macro dataflow graph of the DNN. The DnnWeaver compiler is equipped with our optimization algorithm that tiles, schedules, and batches DNN operations to maximize data reuse and best utilize target FPGA's memory and other resources. The final result is a custom synthesizable accelerator that best matches the needs of the DNN while providing high performance and efficiency gains for the target FPGA.We use DnnWeaver to generate accelerators for a set of eight different DNN models and three different FPGAs, Xilinx Zynq, Altera Stratix V, and Altera Arria 10. We use hardware measurements to compare the generated accelerators to both multicore CPUs (ARM Cortex A15 and Xeon E3) and many-core GPUs (Tegra K1, GTX 650Ti, and Tesla K40).

To exploit this opportunity, there is a need for design abstractions that can systematically incorporate approximation in hardware design. We introduce Axilog, a set of language annotations, that provides the necessary syntax and semantics for approximate hardware design and reuse in Verilog. Axilog enables the designer to relax the accuracy requirements in certain parts of the design, while keeping the critical parts strictly precise. Axilog is coupled with a Relaxability Inference Analysis that automatically infers the relaxable gates and connections from the designer's annotations. The analysis provides formal safety guarantees that approximation will only affect the parts that the designer intended to approximate, referred to as relaxable elements. Finally, the paper describes a synthesis flow that approximates only the relaxable elements. Axilog enables applying approximation in the synthesis process while abstracting away the details of approximate synthesis from the designer. We evaluate Axilog, its analysis, and the synthesis flow using a diverse set of benchmark designs. The results show that the intuitive nature of the language extensions coupled with the automated analysis enables safe approximation of designs even with thousands of lines of code.

Due to the increasing complexity and shrinking design cycles of embedded software, most embedded systems present a host of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited by security attacks. Many attacks are initiated by causing a violation in the properties of data ( e.g., integrity, privacy, access control rules, etc.) associated with a \"trusted\" program that is executing on the system, leading to a range of undesirable effects.In this work, we develop a general framework that provides security assurance against a wide class of security attacks. Our work is based on the observation that a program's permissible behaviorwith respect to data accesses can be characterized by certain properties. We present a hardware/software approach wherein such properties can be encoded as data attributes and enforced as security policies during program execution. These policies may be application-specific (e.g., access control for certain data structures), compiler-generated (e.g., enforcing that variables are accessed only within their scope), or universally applicable to all programs (e.g., disallowing writes to unallocated memory). We show how an embedded system architecture can support such policies by (i) enhancing the memory hierarchy to represent the attributes of each datum as security tags that are linked to it through its lifetime, and (ii) adding a configurable hardware checker that interprets the semantics of the tags and enforces the desired security policies. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in enforcing various security policies for several embedded benchmarks. Our experiments in the context of the Simplescalar framework demonstrate that the proposed solution ensures run-time validation of program data properties with minimal execution time overheads.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis", "pages": "190-195", "numpages": "6", "keywords": "run-time checks, data tagging, secure architectures", "location": "Jersey City, NJ, USA", "series": "CODES+ISSS '05"}, {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Papagiannis, Ioannis and Watcharapichat, Pijika and Muthukumaran, Divya and Pietzuch, Peter", "title": "BrowserFlow: Imprecise Data Flow Tracking to Prevent Accidental Data Disclosure", "year": 2016, "isbn": "9781450343008", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2988336.2988345", "doi": "10.1145/2988336.2988345", "abstract": "With the use of external cloud services such as Google Docs or Evernote in an enterprise setting, the loss of control over sensitive data becomes a major concern for organisations.

This is particularly challenging when users can modify data in arbitrary ways, they employ multiple cloud services, and cloud services cannot be changed.To track the propagation of text data robustly across cloud services, we introduce imprecise data flow tracking, which identifies data flows implicitly by detecting and quantifying the similarity between text fragments. To reason about violations of data disclosure policies, we describe a new text disclosure model that, based on similarity, associates text fragments in web browsers with security tags and identifies unauthorised data flows to untrusted services. We demonstrate the applicability of imprecise data tracking through BrowserFlow, a browser-based middleware that alerts users when they expose potentially sensitive text to an untrusted cloud service.

Commuters have to wait long hours for arrival of buses, and when the bus arrives it is often found to be overcrowded, causing inconvenience in the commuters and discouraging them to use public transit system. The ITS(Intelligent Transport System) developed so far does provide arrival time of buses in real time but such systems are rare which provide the passenger occupancy in real time. Most of such installations use extortionate devices like passenger counting devices, cameras etc installed on the buses and at the bus stops. In this paper we propose a cost effective user participation based mode of collecting information about occupancy level of public transportation system using the potential of smartphones. Smartphones have inbuilt sensors like GPS which can be used to extract locational intelligence of the commuters. Hence, information gets crowdsourced from commuters and they themselves can provide information about occupancy level of a bus using their smartphones. The information so collected is stored in a historical database which is analyzed and processed to obtain occupancy level patterns for different routes on different days. The patterns observed are used to make predictions of occupancy level in a bus.

IoT aims to automate healthcare services through remote monitoring of patients using several vital sign sensors. Remotely collected patient records are then conveyed to the hospital servers through the user's smartphones. Healthcare IoT can thus reduce a lot of overhead while allowing people to access healthcare services all the time and everywhere. However, healthcare IoT exchanges data over the IP-centric Internet which has vulnerabilities related to security, privacy, and mobility. Those features are added to the Internet as external add-ons. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to use Named Data Networking (NDN), which is a future Internet paradigm based on Content-Centric Networking (CCN). NDN has in-built support for user mobility which is well-suited for mobile patients and caregivers. NDN also ensures data security instead of channel security earlier provided by the Internet.

Despite a provider's best efforts, accidental data leakage may occur due to misconfigurations or bugs in the cloud platform. Especially in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds, which rely on weaker forms of isolation, the potential for unnoticed data leakage is high. Prior work to raise tenants' trust in clouds relies on attestation, which limits the management flexibility of providers, or fine-grained data tracking, which has high overheads.We describe CloudSafetyNet (CSN), a lightweight monitoring framework that gives tenants visibility into the propagation of their application data in a cloud environment with low performance overhead. It exploits the incentive of tenants to co-operate with each other to detect accidental data leakage. CSN transparently adds opaque security tags to a subset of form fields in HTTP requests, using a client-side JavaScript library. Socket-level monitors maintain a log of observed tags flowing between application components. Tenants retrieve their logs and identify foreign tags that indicate data leakage. To check the correct operation of CSN, tenants send probe requests with known tags and verify that monitors are logging correctly. Using an implementation of CSN deployed on the OpenShift and AppScale PaaS platforms, we show that it can discover misconfigurations and bugs with a negligible performance impact.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 6th edition of the ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security", "pages": "117-128", "numpages": "12", "keywords": "socket-level monitoring, inter-tenant isolation, data leakage detection, cloud", "location": "Scottsdale, Arizona, USA", "series": "CCSW '14"}, {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Muthukumaran, Divya and O'Keeffe, Dan and Priebe, Christian and Eyers, David and Shand, Brian and Pietzuch, Peter", "title": "FlowWatcher: Defending against Data Disclosure Vulnerabilities in Web Applications", "year": 2015, "isbn": "9781450338325", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813639", "doi": "10.1145/2810103.2813639", "abstract": "Bugs in the authorisation logic of web applications can expose the data of one user to another.

This makes it possible to validate the correct operation of the authorisation logic externally, based on the observed data in HTTP traffic to and from an application.We describe FlowWatcher, an HTTP proxy that mitigates data disclosure vulnerabilities in unmodified web applications. FlowWatcher monitors HTTP traffic and shadows part of an application's access control state based on a rule-based specification of the user-data-access (UDA) policy. The UDA policy states the intended data ownership and how it changes based on observed HTTP requests. FlowWatcher detects violations of the UDA policy by tracking data items that are likely to be unique across HTTP requests and responses of different users.

There is an immediate need to expand our focus to include analysis of high-dimensional and large datasets. Data analysis is becoming a mammoth task, due to incremental increase in data volume and complexity in terms of heterogony of data. It is due to this dynamic computing environment that the existing techniques either need to be modified or discarded to handle new data in multiple high-dimensions. Data clustering is a tool that is used in many disciplines, including data mining, so that meaningful knowledge can be extracted from seemingly unstructured data. The aim of this article is to understand the problem of clustering and various approaches addressing this problem. This article discusses the process of clustering from both microviews (data treating) and macroviews (overall clustering process). Different distance and similarity measures, which form the cornerstone of effective data clustering, are also identified. Further, an in-depth analysis of different clustering approaches focused on data mining, dealing with large-scale datasets is given. These approaches are comprehensively compared to bring out a clear differentiation among them.

Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1)~Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2)~Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort.

Our approach develops a framework for data-driven agent simulation that begins with a discrete-event simulation of the environment populated with generic, flexible agents, then optimizes the decision model of the agents by combining a number of machine learning classification problems. The ML problems predict when an agent will take a certain action in its world and are designed to combine aspects of the agents, gathered from historical data, with dynamic aspects of the environment including the resources, such as tweets, that agents interact with at a given point in time. In this way, each of the agents makes individualized decisions based on their environment, neighbors and history during the simulation, although global simulation data is used to learn accurate generalizations. This approach showed the best performance of all participants in the DARPA challenge across a broad range of metrics. We describe the performance of models both with and without machine learning on measures of cross-platform information spread defined both at the level of the whole population and at the community level. The best-performing model overall combines learned agent behaviors with explicit modeling of bursts in global activity.

We implemented INVISIOS by enhancing a full-system emulator and Linux to model the proposed software and hardware enhancements, and applied it to protect a commercial cryptographic library.

We focus on the problem of optimizing the obfuscation of Boolean formulas and branching programs -- this corresponds to optimizing the \"core obfuscator\" from the work of Garg, Gentry, Halevi, Raykova, Sahai, and Waters (FOCS 2013), and all subsequent works constructing general-purpose obfuscators. This core obfuscator builds upon approximate multilinear maps, where efficiency in proposed instantiations is closely tied to the maximum number of \"levels\" of multilinearity required.The most efficient previous construction of a core obfuscator, due to Barak, Garg, Kalai, Paneth, and Sahai (Eurocrypt 2014), required the maximum number of levels of multilinearity to be O(l s3.64), where s is the size of the Boolean formula to be obfuscated, and l s is the number of input bits to the formula. In contrast, our construction only requires the maximum number of levels of multilinearity to be roughly l s, or only s when considering a keyed family of formulas, namely a class of functions of the form fz(x)=phi(z,x) where phi is a formula of size s. This results in significant improvements in both the total size of the obfuscation and the running time of evaluating an obfuscated formula.Our efficiency improvement is obtained by generalizing the class of branching programs that can be directly obfuscated. This generalization allows us to achieve a simple simulation of formulas by branching programs while avoiding the use of Barrington's theorem, on which all previous constructions relied. Furthermore, the ability to directly obfuscate general branching programs (without bootstrapping) allows us to efficiently apply our construction to natural function classes that are not known to have polynomial-size formulas.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "pages": "646-658", "numpages": "13", "keywords": "efficiency, branching programs, software obfuscation, multilinear maps", "location": "Scottsdale, Arizona, USA", "series": "CCS '14"}, {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Byali, Megha and Joseph, Arun and Patra, Arpita and Ravi, Divya", "title": "Fast Secure Computation for Small Population over the Internet", "year": 2018, "isbn": "9781450356930", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243784", "doi": "10.1145/3243734.3243784", "abstract": "Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with small number of parties is an interesting area of research, primarily due to its ability to model most real-life MPC applications and the simplicity and efficiency of the resulting protocols.

In fact, our 4PC outperforms the 3PC of Mohassel et al. significantly in terms of per-party computation and communication cost. With an extra GC, we improve the round complexity of our 4PC to four rounds. The only 4PC in our setting, given by Ishai et al. [CRYPTO 2015], involves 12 GCs. Assuming an additional broadcast channel, we present a 5-round 3PC with guaranteed output delivery that involves computation and communication of a single GC. A broadcast channel is inevitable in this setting for achieving guaranteed output delivery, owing to an impossibility result in the literature.

Deploying specialized hardware, such as FPGAs, for in-database analytics currently requires hand-designing the hardware and manually routing the data. Instead, DAnA automatically maps a high-level specification of advanced analytics queries to an FPGA accelerator. The accelerator implementation is generated for a User Defined Function (UDF), expressed as a part of an SQL query using a Python-embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL). To realize an efficient in-database integration, DAnA accelerators contain a novel hardware structure, Striders, that directly interface with the buffer pool of the database. Striders extract, cleanse, and process the training data tuples that are consumed by a multi-threaded FPGA engine that executes the analytics algorithm. We integrate DAnA with PostgreSQL to generate hardware accelerators for a range of real-world and synthetic datasets running diverse ML algorithms. Results show that DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL provides, on average, 8.3\u00d7 end-to-end speedup for real datasets, with a maximum of 28.2\u00d7. Moreover, DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL is, on average, 4.0\u00d7 faster than the multi-threaded Apache MADLib running on Greenplum.

We choose gene annotations and gene ontology (GO) evidences as our metadata to highlight the new approach. Application of the newly proposed centrality measures to synthetic networks, and pathogen infected barley's gene co-expression networks resulted in a significantly better prioritization of the nodes.

We found that removing search by name provides some increased privacy protection, because some users were unable to use other means to determine the address of an individual. However, this privacy protection is limited, and interface usability problems presented a comparable barrier.

In response, we have developed Toffee, a sensing approach that extends touch interaction beyond the small confines of a mobile device and onto ad hoc adjacent surfaces, most notably tabletops. This is achieved using a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) correlation. Previous time-of-arrival based systems have required semi-permanent instrumentation of the surface and were too large for use in mobile devices. Our approach requires only a hard tabletop and gravity -- the latter acoustically couples mobile devices to surfaces. We conducted an evaluation, which shows that Toffee can accurately resolve the bearings of touch events (mean error of 4.3\u00b0 with a laptop prototype). This enables radial interactions in an area many times larger than a mobile device; for example, virtual buttons that lie above, below and to the left and right.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th international conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices & services", "pages": "67-76", "numpages": "10", "keywords": "interfaces everywhere, everyday surfaces, time of flight correlation, touch interaction, tdoa, vibro-acoustic sensors, adi, toa, time difference of arrival, around device interaction, tof", "location": "Toronto, ON, Canada", "series": "MobileHCI '14"}, {"type": "article", "author": "Gupta, Abhinav and Singhal, Divya", "title": "A Simplistic Global Median Filtering Forensics Based on Frequency Domain Analysis of Image Residuals", "year": 2019, "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3321508", "doi": "10.1145/3321508", "abstract": "Sophisticated image forgeries introduce digital image forensics as an active area of research. In this area, many researchers have addressed the problem of median filtering forensics. Existing median filtering detectors are adequate to classify median filtered images in uncompressed mode and in compressed mode at high-quality factors. Despite that, the field is lacking a robust method to detect median filtering in low-resolution images compressed with low-quality factors. In this article, a novel feature set (four feature dimensions), based on first-order statistics of frequency contents of median filtered residuals (MFRs) of original and median filtered images, has been proposed. The proposed feature set outperforms handcrafted features-based state-of-the-art detectors in terms of feature set dimensions and detection results obtained for low-resolution images at all quality factors. Also, results reveal the efficacy of proposed method over deep-learning-based median filtering detector. Comprehensive results expose the efficacy of the proposed detector to detect median filtering against other similar manipulations. Additionally, generalization ability test on cross-database images support the cross-validation results on four different databases. Thus, our proposed detector meets the current challenges in the field, to a great extent.", "booktitle": "ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun.

First, the GLS-FLS strategy on the s-TSP instances yields the most promising performance in terms of the near-optimality and the mean CPU time. Second, the GA results are comparable to GLS-FLS outcomes on the same s-TSP instances.
