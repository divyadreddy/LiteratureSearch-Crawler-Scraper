This research considers the recognition of two class of emotions i.e., positive and negative emotions using EEG signals in response to happy, horror, sad, and neutral genres. In a noise-free framework for data acquisition of 50 participants, NeuroSky MindWave 2 is used. The dataset collected is unbalanced i.e., there are more instances of positive classes than negative ones. Therefore, accuracy is not a useful metric to assess the results of the unbalanced dataset because of biased results. So, the primary goal of this research is to address the issue of unbalanced emotion recognition dataset classification, for which we are proposing a novel fitness function known as Gap score (G score), which learns about both the classes by giving them equal importance and being unbiased. The genetic programming (GP) framework in which we implemented G score is named as G-score GP (GGP). The second goal is to assess how distinct genres affect human emotion recognition process and to identify an age group that is more active emotionally when their emotions are elicited. Experiments were conducted on EEG data acquired with a single-channel EEG device. We have compared the performance of GGP for the classification of emotions with state-of-the-art methods. The analysis shows that GGP provides 87.61% classification accuracy by using EEG. In compliance with the self-reported feelings, brain signals of 26 to 35 years of age group provided the highest emotion recognition rate.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "NAKRA2020100561", "title": "\"Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status in pulmonary adenocarcinoma: Multi-institutional data discussion at national conference of \u201cLung Cancer Management in Indian context\u201d\"", "journal": "\"Current Problems in Cancer\"", "volume": "\"44\"", "number": "\"3\"", "pages": "\"100561\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "note": "\"Presented at the 2nd Annual Conference of Research and Educational Society of Medical Oncology held at AIIMS, New Delhi\"", "issn": "\"0147-0272\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2020.100561\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147027220300362\"", "author": "\"Tripti Nakra and Anurag Mehta and Amanjit Bal and Aruna Nambirajan and Deepak Mishra and Divya Midha and Nalini Gupta and Neeraj Arora and Parul Gupta and Pragya Gupta and Varsha Singh and Deepali Jain\"", "keywords": "\" mutation, Lung adenocarcinoma, Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Non small cell lung carcinoma, Cytology\"", "abstract": "\"The presence of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in adenocarcinomas of lung confers sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

A total of 3436 cases of treatment na\u00efve lung adenocarcinoma were tested for EGFR mutations. The overall frequency of EGFR mutations observed was 30.03%. The most common baseline mutation detected was exon 19 deletion followed by L858R point mutation in exon 21. Dual mutations were observed in 6.5% of cases and were predominantly combinations of exon 19 deletion and T790M point mutation in exon 20. Incidence of EGFR mutations was higher among females and non-smokers diagnosed with lung adenocarcinomas. The most common histology in EGFR mutant cases was acinar predominant adenocarcinomas. With nearly one-third of Indian patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations, routine testing for these mutations is important to get the benefit of targeted therapy.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "GARG2020857", "title": "\"Emotion Recognition in Valence-Arousal Space from Multi-channel EEG data and Wavelet based Deep Learning Framework\"", "journal": "\"Procedia Computer Science\"", "volume": "\"171\"", "pages": "\"857 - 867\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "note": "\"Third International Conference on Computing and Network Communications (CoCoNet'19)\"", "issn": "\"1877-0509\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.04.093\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920310644\"", "author": "\"Divya Garg and Gyanendra K.

This research considers two-class (positive and negative) of emotions recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in response to an emotional clip from the genres happy, amusement, sad, and horror. This paper introduces an enhanced fitness function named as eD-score to recognize emotions using EEG signals. The primary goal of this research is to assess how genres affect human emotions. We also analyzed human behaviour based on age and gender responsiveness. We have compared the performance of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), D-score Genetic Programming (DGP), and enhanced D-score Genetic Programming (eDGP) for classification of emotions. The analysis shows that for two class of emotion eDGP provides classification accuracy as 83.33%, 84.69%, 85.88%, and 87.61% for 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, and 10-fold cross-validations. Generalizability and reliability of this approach is evaluated by applying the proposed approach to publicly available EEG datasets DEAP and SEED. When participants in this research are exposed to amusement genre, their reaction is positive emotion. In compliance with the self-reported feelings, brain signals of 26\u201335 years of age group provided the highest emotional identification. Among genders, females are more emotionally active as compared to males. These results affirmed the potential use of our method for recognizing emotions.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "RADHA2020193", "title": "\"An Efficient Detection of HCC-recurrence in Clinical Data Processing using Boosted Decision Tree Classifier\"", "journal": "\"Procedia Computer Science\"", "volume": "\"167\"", "pages": "\"193 - 204\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "note": "\"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Data Science\"", "issn": "\"1877-0509\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.196\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092030661X\"", "author": "\"P.

Nevertheless, it is likely that many physiologically important Ca2+ signals are too small to resolve as discrete events in fluorescence recordings. By analogy with noise analysis of electrophysiological data, we explore here the use of statistical approaches to detect and analyze such Ca2+ noise in images obtained using Ca2+-sensitive indicator dyes. We describe two techniques - power spectrum analysis and spatio-temporal correlation - and demonstrate that both effectively identify discrete, spatially localized calcium release events (Ca2+ puffs). Moreover, we show they are able to detect localized noise fluctuations in a case where discrete events cannot directly be resolved.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "KALACHAVEEDU2018770", "title": "\"Data set on the characterization of the phytoestrogenic extract and isolated compounds of the roots of Inula racemosa Hook F (Asteraceae)\"", "journal": "\"Data in Brief\"", "volume": "\"17\"", "pages": "\"770 - 773\"", "year": "\"2018\"", "issn": "\"2352-3409\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.004\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918301203\"", "author": "\"Mangathayaru Kalachaveedu and Divya Raghavan and Srivani Telapolu and Sarah Kuruvilla and Balakrishna Kedike\"", "keywords": "\"Alantolactone, Isoalantolactone, Stigmasterol glycoside, Inulin\"", "abstract": "\"The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled \u2018 Phyto estrogenic effect of Inula racemosa Hook. f \u2013 A cardio protective root drug in traditional medicine, (Mangathayaru K, Divya R, Srivani T et al., 2018) [1].
