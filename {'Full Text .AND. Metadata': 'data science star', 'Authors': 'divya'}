As the idea of cloud computing entered into a wide implementation today, data access becomes a major security issue. One of the various privacy concerns that are possibly taken into consideration relates to the maintenance of cloud data integrity. Directing users to check data integrity under public audibility is a task to be greatly considered. It is made through third party verifier who provides the client a proof whether the data placed on the server is altered or not. We proposed a dynamic data integrity checking mechanism in which the proof of correct data possession can be made from server on demand. Verifier, on behalf of the client can make a call to the server for verifying the correctness of the stored data, at anytime. This protocol is designed keeping the dynamic nature of cloud as the data placed on the server goes on changing very frequently. Thus, a dynamic data integrity approach is adopted here which includes the RSA encryption system as a method for public cryptosystem. A multiplicative homomorphic property, an idea towards integrity checking of cloud data, is implemented here. The beauty of applying and including the homomorphism property in our protocol is that, the proof can be generated by the third party verifier without having any clue of the original data. Our research is dually aimed at A) generating proof of correct data possession in a dynamic cloud environment B) providing high security of cloud data through homomorphic cryptosystem. The proposed technique is implemented in a very productive and cost effective manner. The testing results of the proposed work are propitious and favorable.", "keywords": "cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data integrity;public key cryptography;proof generation;third party verifier;multiplicative homomorphic property;public cryptosystem;RSA encryption system;stored data correctness verification;server on demand;correct data possession proof;dynamic data integrity checking mechanism;climacteric cloud computing infrastructure;homomorphic cryptosystem;cloud data;coherent dynamic remote integrity check;Servers;Cloud computing;Protocols;Educational institutions;Ciphers;cloud computing;integrity checking;homomorphism;verifier;data possesion;RSA cryptosystem;dynamic cloud data", "doi": "10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2014.6949264", "ISSN": "", "month": "Sep."}, {"type": "@INPROCEEDINGS", "id": "8738596,", "author": "Y. {Wadadekar} and L.

The main aim of this technology is to provide security or safeness which is applicable to all those persons who are sitting in vehicles. VANETs are applicable for providing communications amid vehicles without any necessity of determinate infrastructure. VANETs are useful for providing information amid vehicles because it is not necessary that drivers are aware during the time of driving. It is very difficult to implement an expeditious routing protocol amid vehicles due to propellant features of vehicular environment. The nodes which are used in VANETs have rattling advanced mobility. To reach the final destination, there are plenty of challenges for routing the packets. It creates ambitious technical contents due to prevalent refinements of network topology which is necessary to tackle efficiently. One of the major critical contents is the routing infallibility. End to end of this paper, the main aim is that the researchers and developers could take hold the most disputes and endeavors of the routing protocols by taking the benefits of information. They can take hold in such a way for improving their lustiness and reliability in VANETs. This article has a brief summary of all the routing protocols which are used in VANETs. This paper will be also helpful in elaborating the demerits and demerits of the active routing protocols. It will give a detailed depiction about the different active routing techniques.

Vehicle manufacturers have already deployed various technologies for driving assistance, anti-theft, and infotainment. They are now developing ways to interface mobile devices with vehicles and provide the customer's smart phone or tablet the ability to send/receive information to/from the car. However, such an integration introduces severe security risks to the vehicle. The in-vehicle network was originally designed to operate in a closed environment and thus, security was not of concern. It has now become an important issue due to an increasing number of external interfaces to the in-vehicle network. Several studies have already shown that an in-vehicle network can be easily compromised just by connecting cheap commercial devices and doing reverse engineering. Although research efforts have been made to secure in-vehicle networks, most of them focused on defining security requirements, or presenting attack scenarios without providing any feasible solution. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any study with a specific focus on understanding and analyzing the security aspects of integrating mobile devices with cars.

An exploration of the low-frequency radio window with the resolution and sensitivity essential to meet the scientific objectives will necessarily require a dedicated satellite-based interferometer operating at these frequencies. Such missions have been proposed in the literature for about the past 15 years. Today, the steady and impressive advances in technology and computing resources have brought us to the brink of a quantum jump in the performance and capabilities of such missions, increasing their scientific desirability manyfold. This paper presents the concept design which emerged from a study to investigate the feasibility of a low-frequency satellite-based interferometer operating in the frequency range 0.1\u201340 MHz titled Preparation for Radio Interferometry in Space. In place of trying to stretch and adapt the existing solutions to the requirements of very low frequency interferometry, this study attempts to tailor a design to meet its specific needs. The salient features of the design are an onboard correlator to reduce the data volumes to be transmitted to the Earth by about 2 orders of magnitude, use of three orthogonal dipoles in place of two to achieve better polarization characteristics, direct digitization of the entire radio frequency band of interest allowing broadband observations, an overlap in the observing frequency range with upcoming ground-based instruments to aid in imaging and calibration, and an all-sky imaging capability. The most constraining bottleneck for the present design is the large intraconstellation telemetry requirement. It is expected that technological solutions to meet this requirement will be found in the near future as other formation-flying missions which share this requirement emerge.", "keywords": "Radio interferometry;Radiofrequency interference;Imaging;Space vehicles;Radio astronomy;Instruments;Orbits", "doi": "10.1029/2004RS003211", "ISSN": "1944-799X", "month": "Aug"}, {"type": "@ARTICLE", "id": "5710984,", "author": "F. {Stuker} and C. {Baltes} and K. {Dikaiou} and D. {Vats} and L. {Carrara} and E. {Charbon} and J. {Ripoll} and M. {Rudin", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "title": "Hybrid Small Animal Imaging System Combining Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Fluorescence Tomography Using Single Photon Avalanche Diode Detectors", "year": "2011", "volume": "30", "number": "6", "pages": "1265-1273", "abstract": "The high sensitivity of fluorescence imaging enables the detection of molecular processes in living organisms.

Intelligent homes, an environment of sensors with artificial intelligence integrated with home appliances, can provide the best solution for continuous and remote monitoring of the health of the persons.
