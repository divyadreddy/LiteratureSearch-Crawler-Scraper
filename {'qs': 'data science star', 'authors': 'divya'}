In this study, the mechanism underlying diet-induced obesity on ovarian dysfunction was studied by exposing rats to cafeteria diet (CAFD) for two different durations. For that purpose, 21-day-old female Sprague Dawley rats were fed ad libitum with a standard diet (control group) and a cafeteria diet (CAFD group) for a period of 20 weeks (20 W) and 32 weeks (32 W). We observed obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia in CAFD fed groups. Hyperinsulinemia, hypergonadotrophism, hypertestosteronemia and hyperprogesteronemia were observed in the 20 W-CAFD group. Conversely, in the 32 W-CAFD group hypersecretion declined to hyposecretion. The levels of estradiol remained low during both time periods. The duration of estrous cycle was extended in the CAFD fed rats. The ovary weight was higher in the 20 W-CAFD fed rats but it was drastically reduced over a longer duration cafeteria diet feeding. In the 20 W-CAFD fed rats, the protein levels of LHR, StAR, CYP11A1, 3\u03b2-HSD and 17\u03b2-HSD were increased but FSHR and CYP19A1 levels were decreased in the ovary. On the other hand, gonadotropin receptor and the protein levels of steroidogenic enzymes were decreased in the ovary of 32 W-CAFD fed rats. We conclude that the duration of energy-dense diet consumption has differential regulatory mechanism in altering the ovarian steroid production. In 20 W-CAFD fed rats, hypergonadotropic condition was observed whereas, 32 W-CAFD consumption induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "LINZ2020831", "title": "\"InfraRed Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry (IRASSI): Overview and study results\"", "journal": "\"Advances in Space Research\"", "volume": "\"65\"", "number": "\"2\"", "pages": "\"831 - 849\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "note": "\"High-resolution space-borne radio astronomy\"", "issn": "\"0273-1177\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2019.06.022\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117719304387\"", "author": "\"Hendrik Linz and Divya Bhatia and Luisa Buinhas and Matthias Lezius and Eloi Ferrer and Roger F\u00f6rstner and Kathrin Frankl and Mathias Philips-Blum and Meiko Steen and Ulf Bestmann and Wolfgang H\u00e4nsel and Ronald Holzwarth and Oliver Krause and Thomas Pany\"", "keywords": "\"Far-infrared, Heterodyne interferometry, Formation flying, Laser metrology, Attitude estimation\"", "abstract": "\"The far-infrared (FIR) regime is one of the few wavelength ranges where no astronomical data with sub-arcsecond spatial resolution exist yet. Neither of the medium-term satellite projects like SPICA, Millimetron or OST will resolve this malady. For many research areas, however, information at high spatial and spectral resolution in the FIR, taken from atomic fine-structure lines, from highly excited carbon monoxide (CO) and especially from water lines would open the door for transformative science. These demands call for interferometric concepts. We present here first results of our feasibility study IRASSI (Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry) for an FIR space interferometer. Extending on the principal concept of the previous study ESPRIT, it features heterodyne interferometry within a swarm of five satellite elements. The satellites can drift in and out within a range of several hundred meters, thereby achieving spatial resolutions of <0.1 arcsec over the whole wavelength range of 1\u20136 THz. Precise knowledge on the baselines will be ensured by metrology methods employing laser-based optical frequency combs, for which preliminary ground-based tests have been designed by members of our study team. We first give a motivation on how the science requirements translate into operational and design parameters for IRASSI. Our consortium has put much emphasis on the navigational aspects of such a free-flying swarm of satellites operating in relatively close vicinity. We hence present work on the formation geometry, the relative dynamics of the swarm, and aspects of our investigation towards attitude estimation. Furthermore, we discuss issues regarding the real-time capability of the autonomous relative positioning system, which is an important aspect for IRASSI where, due to the large raw data rates expected, the interferometric correlation has to be done onboard, in quasi-real-time. We also address questions regarding the spacecraft architecture and how a first thermomechanical model is used to study the effect of thermal perturbations on the spacecraft. This will have implications for the necessary internal calibration of the local tie between the laser metrology and the phase centres of the science signals and will ultimately affect the accuracy of the baseline estimations.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "BANU2020106442", "title": "\"Transcriptomic dataset of zebrafish tissues following chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal\"", "journal": "\"Data in Brief\"", "volume": "\"33\"", "pages": "\"106442\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "issn": "\"2352-3409\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106442\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235234092031324X\"", "author": "\"Sofia Banu and Surabhi Srivastava and Arif Mohammed and Gopal Kushawah and Divya Tej Sowpati and Rakesh K Mishra\"", "keywords": "\"Alcohol, Transcriptome, Recovery, Withdrawal, Zebrafish, Brain, Liver\"", "abstract": "\"Alcohol is a psychoactive substance which has detrimental health effects upon consumption.

TFs are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions commonly form promiscuous interactions, yet their unique properties might also benefit specific binding-site selection. We examine this using Msn2 and Yap1, TFs of distinct families that contain long IDRs outside their DNA-binding domains. We find that these IDRs are both necessary and sufficient for localizing to the majority of target promoters. This IDR-directed binding does not depend on any localized domain but results from a multitude of weak determinants distributed throughout the entire IDR sequence. Furthermore, IDR specificity is conserved between distant orthologs, suggesting direct interaction with multiple promoters. We propose that distribution of sensing determinants along extended IDRs accelerates binding-site detection by rapidly localizing TFs to broad DNA regions surrounding these sites.\""}, {"type": "@article", "id": "CHERIAN2021102615", "title": "\"Multifocal cavitating leukodystrophy\u2013A distinct image in mitochondrial LYRM7 mutations\"", "journal": "\"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders\"", "volume": "\"47\"", "pages": "\"102615\"", "year": "\"2021\"", "issn": "\"2211-0348\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102615\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820306891\"", "author": "\"Ajith Cherian and K.P.

Cortical mechanisms of sensory and affective integration, however, remain poorly defined. Here, we investigate the projection from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which encodes the sensory pain information, to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key area for processing pain affect, in freely behaving rats. By using a combination of optogenetics, in\u00a0vivo electrophysiology, and machine learning analysis, we find that a subset of neurons in the ACC receives S1 inputs, and activation of the S1 axon terminals increases the response to noxious stimuli in ACC neurons. Chronic pain enhances this cortico-cortical connection, as manifested by an increased number of ACC neurons that respond to S1 inputs and the magnified contribution of these neurons to the nociceptive response in the ACC. Furthermore, modulation of this S1\u2192ACC projection regulates aversive responses to pain.

We evaluated the performance of the TBDetect kit in a six-site multi-centric validation study on sputum collected from 2086 presumptive TB patients.ResultsThe combined positivity of TBDetect microscopy performed on these sputum samples was 20% (n\u00a0=\u00a0417/2086) vs 16.1% of light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy (LED-FM, n\u00a0=\u00a0337/2086) and 16% of Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) smear microscopy (n\u00a0=\u00a0333/2086). The increment in positivity of TBDetect over both LED-FM and ZN smears was significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The overall sensitivity of TBDetect for six sites was ~55% (202/367, 95% confidence interval (CI): 50, 60%) vs 52% (191/367, 95% CI: 47, 57%) for LED-FM (p 0.14) and 50.9% (187/367, 95% CI: 46, 56%) for ZN smear (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), using Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube culture (MGIT, n\u00a0=\u00a01949, culture positive, n\u00a0=\u00a0367) as the reference standard.
