Materials with certain desired properties like, low weight to reduce gravitational forces, high strength to withstand wind force and gravitational force of the blade, high fatigue resistance to withstand cyclic load, high stiffness to ensure stability of the optimal shape, are studied and reviewed in this paper. It is observed that Composites reinforced with Nano materials exhibit good mechanical properties, Carbon nanotubes are allotropes of carbon with a nanostructure that can have an aspect ratio greater than 1,000,000. These cylindrical carbon molecules have special properties that make them potentially useful in wind turbine blades. Carbon nano tubes can be reinforced with different types of resins to exhibit different properties, which is studied in this work and compared with existing materials used in wind turbine blades. Therefore, the objective of this study is to find a suitable material for wind turbine blade application.\""}}
