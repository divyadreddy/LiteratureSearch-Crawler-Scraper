GCMF performs a two-step filtering phase. 1) A sort-based Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) filtering step detects potentially overlapping polygon pairs up to 20 times faster than the optimized GEOS library routine. 2) A linear time Common MBR filtering step (based on the overlapping area of two given MBRs) that not only eliminates two-third of the candidate polygon pairs but also reduces the number of edges to be considered in the refinement phase by 40-fold on an average based on our experimental results with real datasets. Furthermore, for the refinement phase, GCMF implements a load-balanced parallel point-in-polygon and edge-intersection tests over GPU.

Grounding speculative design in Chernobyl invites us to revisit the relationship between technology and ecology in sites of exclusion and abandon. What happens if we return, or are forced to return, to these hitherto excluded sites? What is it like to live in the aftermath of a disaster whose invisible effects continue for thousands of years? What are some of the technologies that might be seen in such a world and how do they facilitate cohabitation between the humans, plants, and animals of the Zone, and radiation? These questions blur some of the boundaries that can sometimes become too rigid in design fictions, such as the fixed present vs. the flexible future, or diegetic vs. speculative vs. functional prototypes. Moreover, while the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is in many ways unique, Chernobyl is by no means the only Exclusion Zone. It is joined by a growing number of abandoned spaces, from shuttered reactors like Fukushima Daiichi, to nuclear waste sites like Hanford, US, and toxic e-waste sites like Agbogbloshie, Ghana.

These MBR intersections are called Common MBRs.

Our upgraded spatial join system with ST_intersect predicate is able to process more than 600, 000 polygons with more than 2 billions edges on a single GPU in less than a second end-to-end processing time that is 225% time improvement compared to GCMF, the state of the art GPU-based system.

Dehydration is a condition that occurs when the body's organ function is disrupted caused by lack of fluid present in the human body. There are several causes of excessive fluid secretion which cause the body lack of fluid, including excessive sweating, burns, vomiting and diarrhea. There are three levels of dehydration: mild, moderate and severe dehydration. Severe dehydration level can even cause death. Dehydration symptoms can be detected by various methods. One of them is by analyzing the urine condition. Urine condition has information related to dehydration detection: the color and odor of the urine. The higher level of dehydration experienced, the urine will be more concentrated and has a strong smell. In the proposed system, the color of urine was detected using a color sensor which provide urine color information in the form of RGB values. Meanwhile, the smell of urine is directly proportional to the levels of ammonia in the body and was detected by using an ammonia gas sensor that provides information on ammonia levels in the form of ppm values. In this research, testing is done by putting urine to be tested into a transparent test tube. The bottom part of the test tube is inserted into a black box which has been equipped with a color sensor to detect the color of the urine. While the top of the test tube is an open part, it is used to place the ammonia gas sensor to detect the ammonia levels in the urine. The dehydration level classification was done by using Na\u00efve Bayes method. This method was chosen because it can work independently on each feature object that will be classified. The output features of each sensor became the input for Na\u00efve Bayes classification. There were 66 datasets used in this research, 44 data as training data and 22 data as test data.

Our hypothesis is that, when a person listens to music which causes relaxation, he is more likely to attain the alpha state of mind and enhance his memory retention ability. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment on 5 participants. The participants were asked to take a similar quiz twice, under different states of mind.

We discuss the significantly better task performance and preference for the FLUID interface, in particular how touch design may challenge certain assumptions about the performance benefits of WIMP interfaces that do not hold on touch devices, such as the superiority of gestural vs. control panel based interaction.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "pages": "2301-2310", "numpages": "10", "keywords": "user studies, data visualization., touch displays, gesture interfaces", "location": "Paris, France", "series": "CHI '13"}, "41": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Fisher, Danyel and Hildrum, Kris and Hong, Jason and Newman, Mark and Thomas, Megan and Vuduc, Rich", "title": "SWAMI (poster session): a framework for collaborative filtering algorithm development and evaluation", "year": 2000, "isbn": "1581132263", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/345508.345658", "doi": "10.1145/345508.345658", "abstract": "We present a Java-based framework, SWAMI (Shared Wisdom through the Amalgamation of Many Interpretations) for building and studying collaborative filtering systems. SWAMI consists of three components: a prediction engine, an evaluation system, and a visualization component. The prediction engine provides a common interface for implementing different prediction algorithms. The evaluation system provides a standardized testing methodology and metrics for analyzing the accuracy and run-time performance of prediction algorithms. The visualization component suggests how graphical representations can inform the development and analysis of prediction algorithms. We demonstrate SWAMI on the Each Movie data set by comparing three prediction algorithms: a traditional Pearson correlation-based method, support vector machines, and a new accurate and scalable correlation-based method based on clustering techniques.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval", "pages": "366-368", "numpages": "3", "location": "Athens, Greece", "series": "SIGIR '00"}, "42": {"type": "article", "author": "Morris, Meredith Ringel and Danielescu, Andreea and Drucker, Steven and Fisher, Danyel and Lee, Bongshin and schraefel, m. c. and Wobbrock, Jacob O.", "title": "Reducing legacy bias in gesture elicitation studies", "year": 2014, "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2591689", "doi": "10.1145/2591689", "booktitle": "interactions", "pages": "40-45", "numpages": "6"}, "43": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Teevan, Jaime and Cutrell, Edward and Fisher, Danyel and Drucker, Steven M. and Ramos, Gonzalo and Andr\u00e9, Paul and Hu, Chang", "title": "Visual snippets: summarizing web pages for search and revisitation", "year": 2009, "isbn": "9781605582467", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1519008", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1519008", "abstract": "People regularly interact with different representations of Web pages.

Stat! can work with multiple processing engines in the backend; in this demo, we use Stat! with the Microsoft StreamInsight streaming engine. StreamInsight is used to generate incremental early results to queries and refine these results as more data is processed.

Trill fulfills a combination of three requirements for a query processor to serve the diverse big data analytics space: (1) Query Model: Trill is based on a tempo-relational model that enables it to handle streaming and relational queries with early results, across the latency spectrum from real-time to offline; (2) Fabric and Language Integration: Trill is architected as a high-level language library that supports rich data-types and user libraries, and integrates well with existing distribution fabrics and applications; and (3) Performance: Trill's throughput is high across the latency spectrum. For streaming data, Trill's throughput is 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than comparable streaming engines. For offline relational queries, Trill's throughput is comparable to a major modern commercial columnar DBMS.Trill uses a streaming batched-columnar data representation with a new dynamic compilation-based system architecture that addresses all these requirements. In this paper, we describe Trill's new design and architecture, and report experimental results that demonstrate Trill's high performance across diverse analytics scenarios. We also describe how Trill's ability to support diverse analytics has resulted in its adoption across many usage scenarios at Microsoft.", "booktitle": "Proc.

This situation is mirrored at other universities nationwide, as well as in technical industries. Stereotype threat, the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's social group, can result in women not performing as well as their male counterparts in computing, mathematics, and engineering courses. The aftermath of these experiences cause women to fear they do not belong or are not \"smart enough\", resulting in women switching to a different major. Even high-performing women can be subject to these pressures. We present a Scholar model for increasing gender diversity in technology fields and an evaluation of its impact on the retention and success of women in computing and engineering majors. We compare the performance of Scholars to that of non-Scholars with similar demographic and academic backgrounds who entered into the College of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 49th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education", "pages": "459-464", "numpages": "6", "keywords": "diversity, community, gender, scholar programs", "location": "Baltimore, Maryland, USA", "series": "SIGCSE '18"}}
