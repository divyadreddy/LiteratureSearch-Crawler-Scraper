Fixing defects in such programs takes much human effort due to the interplay between imperative code and database-centric logic. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for automated fixing of bugs in the selection condition of database statements (e.g., WHERE clause of SELECT statements) \u2013 a common form of bugs in such programs. Our key observation is that in real-world data, there is information latent in the distribution of data that can be useful to repair selection conditions efficiently. Given a faulty database program and input data, only a part of which induces the defect, our novelty is in determining the correct behavior for the defect-inducing data by taking advantage of the information revealed by the rest of the data. We accomplish this by employing semi-supervised learning to predict the correct behavior for defect-inducing data and by patching up any inaccuracies in the prediction by a SAT-based combinatorial search. Next, we learn a compact decision tree for the correct behavior, including the correct behavior on the defect-inducing data. This tree suggests a plausible fix to the selection condition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on seven realworld examples.

In this paper, we propose to present a data-driven computational framework to evaluate the energy impact on the transportation system at different scales, leveraging the scalable high-performance transportation simulator, Mobiliti. Instead of using empirical energy models, we create a deep-neural-network mapping between the fuel and energy consumption rate with a variety of heterogeneous driving conditions based on dynamometer test datasets, real-world drive cycle survey datasets as well as real-world GPS probe datasets. For the dynamic driving behaviors, machine learning algorithms are applied over the real-world drive cycle datasets to identify the dominant features and to cluster the drive cycles into representative groups, which can be used to generate high-resolution random drive cycles using a Markov chain approach. Using Mobiliti, both urban-scale static evaluations and dynamic analysis at the trip level can be estimated with a significantly improved fidelity.

This is particularly relevant in the embedded domain, where the security solution should be customized to the needs of the target system, while considering other design objectives such as cost, performance, and power. Due to the increasing complexity and shrinking design cycles of embedded software, most embedded systems present a host of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited by security attacks. Many attacks are initiated by causing a violation in the properties of data ( e.g., integrity, privacy, access control rules, etc.) associated with a \"trusted\" program that is executing on the system, leading to a range of undesirable effects.In this work, we develop a general framework that provides security assurance against a wide class of security attacks. Our work is based on the observation that a program's permissible behaviorwith respect to data accesses can be characterized by certain properties. We present a hardware/software approach wherein such properties can be encoded as data attributes and enforced as security policies during program execution. These policies may be application-specific (e.g., access control for certain data structures), compiler-generated (e.g., enforcing that variables are accessed only within their scope), or universally applicable to all programs (e.g., disallowing writes to unallocated memory). We show how an embedded system architecture can support such policies by (i) enhancing the memory hierarchy to represent the attributes of each datum as security tags that are linked to it through its lifetime, and (ii) adding a configurable hardware checker that interprets the semantics of the tags and enforces the desired security policies. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in enforcing various security policies for several embedded benchmarks.

This is particularly challenging when users can modify data in arbitrary ways, they employ multiple cloud services, and cloud services cannot be changed.To track the propagation of text data robustly across cloud services, we introduce imprecise data flow tracking, which identifies data flows implicitly by detecting and quantifying the similarity between text fragments. To reason about violations of data disclosure policies, we describe a new text disclosure model that, based on similarity, associates text fragments in web browsers with security tags and identifies unauthorised data flows to untrusted services. We demonstrate the applicability of imprecise data tracking through BrowserFlow, a browser-based middleware that alerts users when they expose potentially sensitive text to an untrusted cloud service.

Commuters have to wait long hours for arrival of buses, and when the bus arrives it is often found to be overcrowded, causing inconvenience in the commuters and discouraging them to use public transit system. The ITS(Intelligent Transport System) developed so far does provide arrival time of buses in real time but such systems are rare which provide the passenger occupancy in real time. Most of such installations use extortionate devices like passenger counting devices, cameras etc installed on the buses and at the bus stops. In this paper we propose a cost effective user participation based mode of collecting information about occupancy level of public transportation system using the potential of smartphones. Smartphones have inbuilt sensors like GPS which can be used to extract locational intelligence of the commuters. Hence, information gets crowdsourced from commuters and they themselves can provide information about occupancy level of a bus using their smartphones. The information so collected is stored in a historical database which is analyzed and processed to obtain occupancy level patterns for different routes on different days. The patterns observed are used to make predictions of occupancy level in a bus.

Remotely collected patient records are then conveyed to the hospital servers through the user's smartphones. Healthcare IoT can thus reduce a lot of overhead while allowing people to access healthcare services all the time and everywhere. However, healthcare IoT exchanges data over the IP-centric Internet which has vulnerabilities related to security, privacy, and mobility. Those features are added to the Internet as external add-ons.

Despite a provider's best efforts, accidental data leakage may occur due to misconfigurations or bugs in the cloud platform. Especially in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds, which rely on weaker forms of isolation, the potential for unnoticed data leakage is high. Prior work to raise tenants' trust in clouds relies on attestation, which limits the management flexibility of providers, or fine-grained data tracking, which has high overheads.We describe CloudSafetyNet (CSN), a lightweight monitoring framework that gives tenants visibility into the propagation of their application data in a cloud environment with low performance overhead. It exploits the incentive of tenants to co-operate with each other to detect accidental data leakage. CSN transparently adds opaque security tags to a subset of form fields in HTTP requests, using a client-side JavaScript library. Socket-level monitors maintain a log of observed tags flowing between application components. Tenants retrieve their logs and identify foreign tags that indicate data leakage. To check the correct operation of CSN, tenants send probe requests with known tags and verify that monitors are logging correctly. Using an implementation of CSN deployed on the OpenShift and AppScale PaaS platforms, we show that it can discover misconfigurations and bugs with a negligible performance impact.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 6th edition of the ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security", "pages": "117-128", "numpages": "12", "keywords": "cloud, data leakage detection, inter-tenant isolation, socket-level monitoring", "location": "Scottsdale, Arizona, USA", "series": "CCSW '14"}, "11": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Muthukumaran, Divya and O'Keeffe, Dan and Priebe, Christian and Eyers, David and Shand, Brian and Pietzuch, Peter", "title": "FlowWatcher: Defending against Data Disclosure Vulnerabilities in Web Applications", "year": 2015, "isbn": "9781450338325", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813639", "doi": "10.1145/2810103.2813639", "abstract": "Bugs in the authorisation logic of web applications can expose the data of one user to another.

The UDA policy states the intended data ownership and how it changes based on observed HTTP requests. FlowWatcher detects violations of the UDA policy by tracking data items that are likely to be unique across HTTP requests and responses of different users.

Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1)~Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2)~Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation under the Smallbank benchmark as well as under a custom workload shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 12x, while decreasing the average latency to almost half.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data", "pages": "105-122", "numpages": "18", "keywords": "distributed ledger, concurrenct control, hyperledger, blockchain, transactions, fabric, ledger, information systems, distributed systems", "location": "Amsterdam, Netherlands", "series": "SIGMOD '19"}, "17": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Padmanabhan, Divya", "title": "Theoretical Models for Learning from Multiple, Heterogenous and Strategic Agents", "year": 2017, "publisher": "International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems", "address": "Richland, SC", "doi": "10.5555/3091125.3091466", "abstract": "With the advent of internet enabled hand-held mobile devices, there is a proliferation of user generated data.

The ML problems predict when an agent will take a certain action in its world and are designed to combine aspects of the agents, gathered from historical data, with dynamic aspects of the environment including the resources, such as tweets, that agents interact with at a given point in time. In this way, each of the agents makes individualized decisions based on their environment, neighbors and history during the simulation, although global simulation data is used to learn accurate generalizations.

Extensive simulation results show that the OnChip-FIB scheme can achieve 1.06 \u03bcs measured lookup latency with a 26% on-chip block memory usage in a single Xilinx UltraScale FPGA for 50K named dataset.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking", "pages": "81-89", "numpages": "9", "keywords": "FIB, NDN, forwarding, name lookup, named data networking", "location": "Bangalore, India", "series": "ICDCN '19"}, "34": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Ananth, Prabhanjan and Gupta, Divya and Ishai, Yuval and Sahai, Amit", "title": "Optimizing Obfuscation: Avoiding Barrington's Theorem", "year": 2014, "isbn": "9781450329576", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660342", "doi": "10.1145/2660267.2660342", "abstract": "In this work, we seek to optimize the efficiency of secure general-purpose obfuscation schemes. We focus on the problem of optimizing the obfuscation of Boolean formulas and branching programs -- this corresponds to optimizing the \"core obfuscator\" from the work of Garg, Gentry, Halevi, Raykova, Sahai, and Waters (FOCS 2013), and all subsequent works constructing general-purpose obfuscators. This core obfuscator builds upon approximate multilinear maps, where efficiency in proposed instantiations is closely tied to the maximum number of \"levels\" of multilinearity required.The most efficient previous construction of a core obfuscator, due to Barak, Garg, Kalai, Paneth, and Sahai (Eurocrypt 2014), required the maximum number of levels of multilinearity to be O(l s3.64), where s is the size of the Boolean formula to be obfuscated, and l s is the number of input bits to the formula. In contrast, our construction only requires the maximum number of levels of multilinearity to be roughly l s, or only s when considering a keyed family of formulas, namely a class of functions of the form fz(x)=phi(z,x) where phi is a formula of size s. This results in significant improvements in both the total size of the obfuscation and the running time of evaluating an obfuscated formula.Our efficiency improvement is obtained by generalizing the class of branching programs that can be directly obfuscated. This generalization allows us to achieve a simple simulation of formulas by branching programs while avoiding the use of Barrington's theorem, on which all previous constructions relied. Furthermore, the ability to directly obfuscate general branching programs (without bootstrapping) allows us to efficiently apply our construction to natural function classes that are not known to have polynomial-size formulas.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "pages": "646-658", "numpages": "13", "keywords": "software obfuscation, branching programs, efficiency, multilinear maps", "location": "Scottsdale, Arizona, USA", "series": "CCS '14"}, "35": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Byali, Megha and Joseph, Arun and Patra, Arpita and Ravi, Divya", "title": "Fast Secure Computation for Small Population over the Internet", "year": 2018, "isbn": "9781450356930", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243784", "doi": "10.1145/3243734.3243784", "abstract": "Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with small number of parties is an interesting area of research, primarily due to its ability to model most real-life MPC applications and the simplicity and efficiency of the resulting protocols. In this work, we present efficient, constant-round 3-party (3PC) and 4-party (4PC) protocols in the honest-majority setting that achieve strong security notions of fairness (corrupted parties receive their output only if all honest parties receive output) and guaranteed output delivery (corrupted parties cannot prevent honest parties from receiving their output). Being constant-round, our constructions are suitable for Internet-like high-latency networks and are built from garbled circuits (GC). Assuming the minimal model of pairwise-private channels, we present two protocols that involve computation and communication of a single GC-- (a) a 4-round 3PC with fairness, (b) a 5-round 4PC with guaranteed output delivery. Empirically, our protocols are on par with the best known 3PC protocol of Mohassel et al. [CCS 2015] that only achieves security with selective abort, in terms of the computation time, LAN runtime, WAN runtime and communication cost. In fact, our 4PC outperforms the 3PC of Mohassel et al. significantly in terms of per-party computation and communication cost. With an extra GC, we improve the round complexity of our 4PC to four rounds. The only 4PC in our setting, given by Ishai et al. [CRYPTO 2015], involves 12 GCs. Assuming an additional broadcast channel, we present a 5-round 3PC with guaranteed output delivery that involves computation and communication of a single GC. A broadcast channel is inevitable in this setting for achieving guaranteed output delivery, owing to an impossibility result in the literature. The overall broadcast communication of our protocol is nominal and most importantly, is independent of the circuit size.

As such, there is a void of solutions that enables hardware acceleration at the intersection of these disjoint fields. This paper sets out to be the initial step towards a unifying solution for in-Database Acceleration of Advanced Analytics (DAnA). Deploying specialized hardware, such as FPGAs, for in-database analytics currently requires hand-designing the hardware and manually routing the data. Instead, DAnA automatically maps a high-level specification of advanced analytics queries to an FPGA accelerator. The accelerator implementation is generated for a User Defined Function (UDF), expressed as a part of an SQL query using a Python-embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL). To realize an efficient in-database integration, DAnA accelerators contain a novel hardware structure, Striders, that directly interface with the buffer pool of the database. Striders extract, cleanse, and process the training data tuples that are consumed by a multi-threaded FPGA engine that executes the analytics algorithm. We integrate DAnA with PostgreSQL to generate hardware accelerators for a range of real-world and synthetic datasets running diverse ML algorithms. Results show that DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL provides, on average, 8.3\u00d7 end-to-end speedup for real datasets, with a maximum of 28.2\u00d7. Moreover, DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL is, on average, 4.0\u00d7 faster than the multi-threaded Apache MADLib running on Greenplum.

This is achieved using a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) correlation. Previous time-of-arrival based systems have required semi-permanent instrumentation of the surface and were too large for use in mobile devices. Our approach requires only a hard tabletop and gravity -- the latter acoustically couples mobile devices to surfaces. We conducted an evaluation, which shows that Toffee can accurately resolve the bearings of touch events (mean error of 4.3\u00b0 with a laptop prototype).

This happens because the existing mechanisms consider the worst case scenario where the means of the agents' stochastic rewards are separated by a very small amount that depends on T. We make, and, exploit the crucial observation that in most scenarios, the separation between the agents' rewards is rarely a function of T. Moreover, in the case that the rewards of the arms are arbitrarily close, the regret contributed by such sub-optimal arms is minimal. Our idea is to allow the center to indicate the resolution, \u0394, with which the agents must be distinguished. This immediately leads us to introduce the notion of \u0394-Regret. Using sponsored search auctions as a concrete example (the same idea applies for other applications as well), we propose a dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and individually rational (IR), deterministic MAB mechanism, based on ideas from the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) family of MAB algorithms.

It promotes low data access latency, high bandwidth, massive parallelism, and low power consumption. The skyline operator is a known primitive used to identify those multi-dimensional points offering optimal trade-offs within a given dataset. For large multidimensional dataset, calculating the skyline is extensively compute and data intensive. Although, PIM systems present opportunities to mitigate this cost, their execution model relies on all processors operating in isolation with minimal data exchange. This prohibits direct application of known skyline optimizations which are inherently sequential, creating dependencies and large intermediate results that limit the maximum parallelism, throughput, and require an expensive merging phase.In this work, we address these challenges by introducing the first skyline algorithm for PIM architectures, called DSky. It is designed to be massively parallel and throughput efficient by leveraging a novel work assignment strategy that emphasizes load balancing. Our experiments demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for CPUs and GPUs, in most cases. DSky achieves 2\u00d7 to 14\u00d7 higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art solutions on competing CPU and GPU architectures. Furthermore, we showcase DSky's good scaling properties which are intertwined with PIM's ability to allocate resources with minimal added cost. In addition, we showcase an order of magnitude better energy consumption compared to CPUs and GPUs.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques", "pages": "1-12", "numpages": "12", "keywords": "processing-in-memory, massive parallelism, skyline queries, processing-near-memory, load balancing, pareto dominance", "location": "Limassol, Cyprus", "series": "PACT '18"}, "56": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Paliwal, Divya and Bhatnagar, Raj", "title": "A Negotiation Protocol for Optimal Decision Making by Collaborating Agents", "year": 2014, "isbn": "9781479941438", "publisher": "IEEE Computer Society", "address": "USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.163", "doi": "10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.163", "abstract": "Through presented paper, we provide a simple negotiation model in a multi-agent system, where every agent has incomplete set of information about all other agents.

To achieve true autonomy, robots need to continuously process and interact with their environment through computationally-intensive motion planning and control algorithms under a low power budget. Specialized architectures offer a potent choice to provide low-power, high-performance accelerators for these algorithms. Instead of taking a traditional route which profiles and maps hot code regions to accelerators, this paper delves into the algorithmic characteristics of the application domain. We observe that many motion planning and control algorithms are formulated as a constrained optimization problems solved online through Model Predictive Control (MPC). While models and objective functions differ between robotic systems and tasks, the structure of the optimization problem and solver remain fixed. Using this theoretical insight, we create RoboX, an end-to-end solution which exposes a high-level domain-specific language to roboticists. This interface allows roboticists to express the physics of the robot and its task in a form close to its concise mathematical expressions. The RoboX backend then automatically maps this high-level specification to a novel programmable architecture, which harbors a programmable memory access engine and compute-enabled interconnects. Hops in the interconnect are augmented with simple functional units that either operate on in-fight data or are bypassed according a micro-program. Evaluations with six different robotic systems and tasks show that RoboX provides a 29.4 x (7.3 x) speedup and 22.1 x (79.4 x) performance-per-watt improvement over an ARM Cortex A57 (Intel Xeon E3).

Most current commercial designs are symmetric CMPs (SCMP) in which each core is identical and range from a simple RISC processor to a complex out-of-order x86 processor. Some researchers have proposed asymmetric CMPs (ACMP) consisting of multiple types of cores. While less of an issue for ACMPs, the fixed nature of both these architectures makes them vulnerable to mismatches between the granularity of the cores and the parallelism in the workload, which can cause inefficient execution. To remedy this weakness, recent research has proposed flexible-core CMPs (FCMP), which have the capability of aggregating multiple small processing cores to form larger logical processors.

It is the compiler's responsibility to fit programs into pipeline resources. However, switch compilers, which use rewrite rules to generate switch machine code, often reject programs because the rules fail to transform programs into a form that can be mapped to a pipeline's limited resources---even if a mapping actually exists.This paper presents a compiler, Chipmunk, which formulates code generation as a program synthesis problem. Chipmunk uses a program synthesis engine, SKETCH, to transform high-level programs down to switch machine code. However, naively formulating code generation as program synthesis can lead to long compile times. Hence, we develop a new domain-specific synthesis technique, slicing, which reduces compile times by 1-387x and 51x on average.Using a switch hardware simulator, we show that Chipmunk compiles many programs that a previous rule-based compiler, Domino, rejects. Chipmunk also produces machine code with fewer pipeline stages than Domino. A Chipmunk backend for the Tofino programmable switch shows that program synthesis can produce machine code for high-speed switches.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Annual conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication", "pages": "44-61", "numpages": "18", "keywords": "program synthesis, packet processing pipelines, slicing, Programmable switches, code generation", "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '20"}, "72": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Agrahri, Arun Kumar and Manickam, Divya Anand Thattandi and Riedl, John", "title": "Can people collaborate to improve the relevance of search results?", "year": 2008, "isbn": "9781605580937", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/1454008.1454052", "doi": "10.1145/1454008.1454052", "abstract": "Search engines are among the most-used resources on the internet.

Although this architecture provides more flexibility for the running application to determine the optimal run-time settings that maximize energy-efficiency, due to the interdependence of various tuning parameters such as the type of core, run-time voltage and frequency, and the number of threads, the scheduling becomes more challenging. More importantly, the impact of Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of the On-Chip Voltage Regulators (OCVRs) is another important parameter that makes it more challenging to schedule multithreaded applications on HMPs. In this paper, the importance of concurrent optimization and fine-tuning of the circuit and architectural parameters for energy-efficient scheduling on HMPs is addressed to harness the power of heterogeneity. In addition, the scheduling challenges for multithreaded applications are investigated for HMP architectures that account for the impact of power conversion efficiency. A highly accurate learning-based model is developed for energy-efficiency prediction to guide the scheduling decision. Using the predictive model, we further develop a PCE-aware scheduling scheme is developed for effective mapping of multithreaded applications onto an HMP.

When the granularity of parallelism in the tasks matches the granularity of the processing cores, a CMP will be at its most efficient. To adjust the granularity of a core to the tasks running on it, recent research has proposed flexible-core chip multiprocessors, which typically consist of a number of small processing cores that can be aggregated to form larger logical processors.

In a rather disjoint effort, the community is focusing mostly on high performance single-node accelerators for learning. This work bridges these two paradigms and offers CoSMIC, a full computing stack constituting language, compiler, system software, template architecture, and circuit generators, that enable programmable acceleration of learning at scale. CoSMIC enables programmers to exploit scale-out acceleration using FPGAs and Programmable ASICs (P-ASICs) from a high-level and mathematical Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Nonetheless, CoSMIC does not require programmers to delve into the onerous task of system software development or hardware design. CoSMIC achieves three conflicting objectives of efficiency, automation, and programmability, by integrating a novel multi-threaded template accelerator architecture and a cohesive stack that generates the hardware and software code from its high-level DSL. CoSMIC can accelerate a wide range of learning algorithms that are most commonly trained using parallel variants of gradient descent. The key is to distribute partial gradient calculations of the learning algorithms across the accelerator-augmented nodes of the scale-out system. Additionally, CoSMIC leverages the parallelizability of the algorithms to offer multi-threaded acceleration within each node. Multi-threading allows CoSMIC to efficiently exploit the numerous resources that are becoming available on modern FPGAs/P-ASICs by striking a balance between multi-threaded parallelism and single-threaded performance. CoSMIC takes advantage of algorithmic properties of ML to offer a specialized system software that optimizes task allocation, role-assignment, thread management, and internode communication. We evaluate the versatility and efficiency of CoSMIC for 10 different machine learning applications from various domains. On average, a 16-node CoSMIC with UltraScale+ FPGAs offers 18.8\u00d7 speedup over a 16-node Spark system with Xeon processors while the programmer only writes 22--55 lines of code. CoSMIC offers higher scalability compared to the state-of-the-art Spark; scaling from 4 to 16 nodes with CoSMIC yields 2.7\u00d7 improvements whereas Spark offers 1.8\u00d7.

Approximation is useful only if its impact on application output quality is acceptable to the users. However, there is a lack of systematic solutions and studies that explore users' perspective on the effects of approximation. In this paper, we seek to provide one such solution for the developers to probe and discover the boundary of quality loss that most users will deem acceptable. We propose AxGames, a crowdsourced solution that enables developers to readily infer a statistical common ground from the general public through three entertaining games. The users engage in these games by betting on their opinion about the quality loss of the final output while the AxGames framework collects statistics about their perceptions. The framework then statistically analyzes the results to determine the acceptable levels of quality for a pair of (application, approximation technique). The three games are designed such that they effectively capture quality requirements with various tradeoffs and contexts. To evaluate AxGames, we examine seven diverse applications that produce user perceptible outputs and cover a wide range of domains, including image processing, optical character recognition, speech to text conversion, and audio processing. We recruit 700 participants/users through Amazon's Mechanical Turk to play the games that collect statistics about their perception on different levels of quality. Subsequently, the AxGames framework uses the Clopper-Pearson exact method, which computes a binomial proportion confidence interval, to analyze the collected statistics for each level of quality. Using this analysis, AxGames can statistically project the quality level that satisfies a given percentage of users. The developers can use these statistical projections to tune the level of approximation based on the user experience. We find that the level of acceptable quality loss significantly varies across applications. For instance, to satisfy 90% of users, the level of acceptable quality loss is 2% for one application (image processing) and 26% for another (audio processing). Moreover, the pattern with which the crowd responds to approximation takes significantly different shape and form depending on the class of applications.

We present techniques to extract input properties, encoding convex predicates on the input space that imply given output properties and layer properties, representing network properties captured in the hidden layers that imply the desired output behavior. We apply our techniques on networks for the MNIST and ACASXU applications. Our experiments highlight the use of the inferred properties in a variety of tasks, such as explaining predictions, providing robustness guarantees, simplifying proofs, and network distillation.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering", "pages": "797-809", "numpages": "13", "location": "San Diego, California", "series": "ASE '19"}, "87": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Srinivasan, Karthik and Singh, Dineshkumar and Lonkar, Vaibhav and Vutla, Pavan and Alla, Divya and Sarangi, Sanat", "title": "Feedback System for Improving Capturing Quality and Quantity of Livestock Images Using Deep Learning Technology", "year": 2018, "isbn": "9781450362146", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3297121.3297138", "doi": "10.1145/3297121.3297138", "abstract": "Livestock body parameters like shape, horn, teeth, muzzle, and udder provide useful information to determine livestock age and health. It is very difficult to continuously monitor and measure these parameters for 300 million bovine animals in India. We developed a Deep Learning (DL) based intelligent Livestock Health Monitoring System (LHMS) which derives these parameters from the livestock images. We developed a mobile application for Veterinarians and livestock Artificial Insemination Technicians (AIT) to collect and monitor livestock data and images throughout their pregnancy lifecycle. Though AIT captured 1.87 Lakh livestock data since 2016, it had only 1000 images.We conducted multiple iteration of the Design Thinking (DT) research to understand the challenges in the image capturing process. It was difficult for a human to see each image and provide feedback to the AITs about quality of images. DL models revealed the poor quality of the images, such as missing livestock as well as noisy and blurred images. Model accuracy decreased due to this. To address this challenge DL were methods to analyze the image, train system and generated an AIT Image Score (AIS) based on factors like quantity of images, accuracy of images, frequency of upload, geo-location etc. Based on AIS, we created a personalized feedback message and training instructions on how to click and collect images for each AIT.

A big fraction of these cabs are managed by web-based cab operators, who provide the service to commuters through a mobile application. Sometimes, the drivers of these cabs swindle the customers by over-charging them for the journey. This happens when the cab drivers start the billing process before the commuter boards the cab and/or, when they end the billing process much later than when the commuter has deboarded the cab. Such cases can be prevented by detecting and recording the actual boarding and deboarding time of the commuter. Our proposed system handles such cases of fraud, by detecting the boarding and deboarding events of commuter in the cab. It suggests to do so by using the pressure values recorded by the barometer sensor of the smartphone of the commuter, and of a barometer device installed in the cab or using the barometer sensor of smartphone of the cab driver. The core of our mechanism is a comparison of the sequence of barometer values across two devices: the commuter's and the driver's. Since barometer sensor is passive and uses very low power, it makes overall system economical in terms of power consumption. Further the proposed system necessitates minimal amount of data to be sent to the server for processing. The proposed system is tested in varied environmental conditions and good average accuracy is observed in all the cases.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 7th ACM International Workshop on Mobility, Interference, and MiddleWare Management in HetNets", "pages": "1-6", "numpages": "6", "keywords": "Sensors, Smartphones, Barometer Sensor, Commuter Tracking, Location-Based Services", "location": "Chennai, India", "series": "MobiMWareHN'17"}, "89": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Vishwakarma, Santosh K. and Bhatnagar, Divya and Lakhtaria, Kamaljit I. and Sharma, Akhilesh", "title": "On Using Chi Square Based Term Scoring for Static Index Pruning", "year": 2014, "isbn": "9781450332163", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2677855.2677897", "doi": "10.1145/2677855.2677897", "abstract": "In this study, a novel technique for static index pruning based on document relevance with chi square scoring is presented.

Often, there is a lack of consensus about basic concepts, such as whatconstitutes a security-sensitive operation.In this paper, we propose an automated hook placement approach that is motivated by a novel observation --- that the deliberate choices made by clients for objects from server collections and for processing those objects must all be authorized.

This sector generates a retail turnover of Rs. 28,511 crore and provides cheap animal protein to 138 million fish eaters. Every week 0.9 Million Indian fishermen from 3288 villages venture into the deep sea to catch their livelihood. Fishing is a high risk profession. Fishermen and the laborers, on the boat, face high navigational and operational risks due to the dynamic nature of sea wind, wave, and sea current. Lack of preparedness and forewarning increases the risk of human life and also increases risk involved in losing the boat, fishing gears and nets. Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) generates Ocean State Forecast (OSF) information like Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories and remote sensing images for Wind direction and Wave height which helps fishermen to plan their trip.An ICT based solution was required to disseminate such high tech information to low literate fishermen.

While several commodity systems now include mandatory access control (MAC) enforcement to protect the individual components, the complexity of such MAC policies and the myriad of possible interactions among individual hosts in distributed systems makes it difficult to identify the attack paths available to adversaries. As a result, security practitioners react to vulnerabilities as adversaries uncover them, rather than proactively protecting the system's data integrity. In this paper, we develop a mostly-automated method to transform a set of commodity MAC policies into a system-wide policy that proactively protects system integrity, approximating the Clark-Wilson integrity model. The method uses the insights from the Clark-Wilson model, which requires integrity verification of security-critical data and mediation at program entrypoints, to extend existing MAC policies with the proactive mediation necessary to protect system integrity. We demonstrate the practicality of producing Clark-Wilson policies for distributed systems on a web application running on virtualized Ubuntu SELinux hosts, where our method finds: (1) that only 27 additional entrypoint mediators are sufficient to mediate the threats of remote adversaries over the entire distributed system and (2) and only 20 additional local threats require mediation to approximate Clark-Wilson integrity comprehensively.

A major portion of known security attacks against software systems can be attributed to this shortcoming, including the well-known stack overflow, heap overflow, and format string attacks. Despite their limitations, the flexibility, performance, and ease of use of these languages have made them the choice of most embedded software developers. Researchers have proposed various techniques to enhance programs for memory safety; however, they are all subject to severe performance penalties, making their use impractical in most scenarios. In this paper, we present architectural enhancements to enable efficient, memory-safe execution of software on embedded processors. The key insight behind our approach is to extend embedded processors with hardware that significantly accelerates the execution of the additional computations involved in memory-safe execution. Specifically, we design custom instructions to perform various kinds of memory-safety checks and augment the instruction set of a state-of-the-art extensible processor (Xtensa from Tensilica, Inc.) to implement them. We demonstrate the application of the proposed architectural enhancements using CCured, an existing tool for type-safe retrofitting of C programs. The tool uses a type-inferencing engine that is built around strong type-safety theory and is provably safe. Simulations of memory-safe versions of popular embedded benchmarks on a cycle-accurate simulator modeling a typical embedded system configuration indicate an average performance improvement of 2.3x, and a maximum of 4.6x when using the proposed architecture. These enhancements entail minimal (less than 10%) hardware overhead to the base processor. Our approach is completely automated, and applicable to any C program, making it a promising and practical approach for addressing the growing security and reliability concerns in embedded software.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis", "pages": "106-111", "numpages": "6", "keywords": "type safety, extensible processors, memory safety", "location": "Seoul, Korea", "series": "CODES+ISSS '06"}, "123": {"type": "inproceedings", "author": "Vinodini Ramesh, Maneesha and Pradeep, Preeja and Divya, P. and Arya Devi, R.

However, there is a vast decision space in which each invocation can either be delegated to the accelerator---improving performance and efficiency--or run on the precise core---maintaining quality. In this paper we introduce Mithra, a co-designed hardware-software solution, that navigates these tradeoffs to deliver high performance and efficiency while lowering the final quality loss. Mithra seeks to identify whether each individual accelerator invocation will lead to an undesirable quality loss and, if so, directs the processor to run the original precise code.This identification is cast as a binary classification task that requires a cohesive co-design of hardware and software. The hardware component performs the classification at runtime and exposes a knob to the software mechanism to control quality tradeoffs. The software tunes this knob by solving a statistical optimization problem that maximizes benefits from approximation while providing statistical guarantees that final quality level will be met with high confidence. The software uses this knob to tune and train the hardware classifiers. We devise two distinct hardware classifiers, one table-based and one neural network based. To understand the efficacy of these mechanisms, we compare them with an ideal, but infeasible design, the oracle. Results show that, with 95% confidence the table-based design can restrict the final output quality loss to 5% for 90% of unseen input sets while providing 2.5\u00d7 speedup and 2.6\u00d7 energy efficiency. The neural design shows similar speedup however, improves the efficiency by 13%. Compared to the table-based design, the oracle improves speedup by 26% and efficiency by 36%.

Determining the routes that lead to the traffic congestion segment is also vital in devising mitigation strategies. Further, crowdsourcing this information allows for use of these strategies quickly and in places where infrastructure is not available. In this work, we present an unconventional method, using the barometer sensor of mobile phones to (a) detect road traffic congestion and (b) estimate the paths that lead to the congested road segment. We make the observation that roads are not completely flat and very often, altitude varies along the road. The barometer sensor chips are sensitive enough to measure these variations and consume very little energy of the mobile phone, compared to other sensors such as the GPS or accelerometer. We devise a feature set to map the rate of change of this altitude as the user moves into activities characterized as \u201cstill\u201d and \u201cmotion,\u201d which are further used by the traffic congestion detection algorithm (RoadSphygmo) to classify the group of users as being in \u201cmoving,\u201d \u201ccongestion,\u201d &nbsp;or \u201cstuck\u201d states. To estimate the paths that lead to the congested road segment, we compare the user\u2019s barometer sensor readings with a pre-stored road signature of barometer values using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We show that by using correlation of barometer sensor values, we can determine if users are in the same vehicle. We crowdsource this information from multiple mobile phones and use majority voting technique to improve the accuracy of traffic congestion detection and path estimation. We find a significant increase in the accuracies using crowdsourced information as compared to individual mobile phones. Further, we show that we can use barometer sensor for other applications such as bus occupancy, boarding/deboarding of a vehicle, and so on. The validation of the state determined by RoadSphygmo is done by comparing it with average GPS speed calculated during the same time period.

However, the demands of personalization stand unfulfilled by current agent training paradigms such as machine learning, which require many orders of data to train agents on a single task. In sequential decision making domains, Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables this need, when a priori training of desired behaviors is intractable. Prior work has leveraged user input to train agents by mapping them to numerical reward signals. However, recent approaches have identified inconsistent human feedback as a bottleneck to achieving best-case performance. In this work, we present empirical evidence to show that human perception affected by contrast effects distorts their feedback to Reinforcement Learning agents. Through a set of studies involving 900 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were asked to give feedback to RL agents, we show that participants significantly underrate an agent's actions after being exposed to an agent of higher competence on the same task. To understand the significance of this effect on agent performance during training, we then simulate trainers that underrate actions of an agent based on past performance - creating a systematically skewed feedback signal - integrated into an actor-critic framework. Our results show that agent performance is reduced by up to 98% in the presence of systematic skews in human feedback in Atari environments.

FPGAs are an attractive choice for DNNs since they offer a programmable substrate for acceleration and are becoming available across different market segments. However, obtaining both performance and energy efficiency with FPGAs is a laborious task even for expert hardware designers. Furthermore, the large memory footprint of DNNs, coupled with the FPGAs' limited on-chip storage makes DNN acceleration using FPGAs more challenging. This work tackles these challenges by devising DnnWeaver, a framework that automatically generates a synthesizable accelerator for a given (DNN, FPGA) pair from a high-level specification in Caffe [1]. To achieve large benefits while preserving automation, DnnWeaver generates accelerators using hand-optimized design templates. First, DnnWeaver translates a given high-level DNN specification to its novel ISA that represents a macro dataflow graph of the DNN. The DnnWeaver compiler is equipped with our optimization algorithm that tiles, schedules, and batches DNN operations to maximize data reuse and best utilize target FPGA's memory and other resources. The final result is a custom synthesizable accelerator that best matches the needs of the DNN while providing high performance and efficiency gains for the target FPGA.We use DnnWeaver to generate accelerators for a set of eight different DNN models and three different FPGAs, Xilinx Zynq, Altera Stratix V, and Altera Arria 10. We use hardware measurements to compare the generated accelerators to both multicore CPUs (ARM Cortex A15 and Xeon E3) and many-core GPUs (Tegra K1, GTX 650Ti, and Tesla K40).

Using a Global Positioning System is not only power-hungry, but also unavailable in many locations. While there has been work on cellular-based localization, we consider an unexplored opportunity to improve location accuracy by combining cellular information across multiple mobile devices located near each other. For instance, this opportunity may arise in the context of public transport units having multiple travelers.Based on theoretical analysis and an extensive experimental study on several public transportation routes in two cities, we show that combining cellular information across nearby phones considerably improves location accuracy. Combining information across phones is especially useful when a phone has to use another phone\u2019s fingerprint database, in a fingerprinting-based localization scheme. Both the median and 90 percentile errors reduce significantly. The location accuracy also improves irrespective of whether we combine information across phones connected to the same or different cellular operators.Sharing information across phones can raise privacy concerns. To address this, we have developed an id-free broadcast mechanism, using audio as a medium, to share information among mobile phones.

To exploit this opportunity, there is a need for design abstractions that can systematically incorporate approximation in hardware design. We introduce Axilog, a set of language annotations, that provides the necessary syntax and semantics for approximate hardware design and reuse in Verilog. Axilog enables the designer to relax the accuracy requirements in certain parts of the design, while keeping the critical parts strictly precise. Axilog is coupled with a Relaxability Inference Analysis that automatically infers the relaxable gates and connections from the designer's annotations. The analysis provides formal safety guarantees that approximation will only affect the parts that the designer intended to approximate, referred to as relaxable elements. Finally, the paper describes a synthesis flow that approximates only the relaxable elements. Axilog enables applying approximation in the synthesis process while abstracting away the details of approximate synthesis from the designer. We evaluate Axilog, its analysis, and the synthesis flow using a diverse set of benchmark designs. The results show that the intuitive nature of the language extensions coupled with the automated analysis enables safe approximation of designs even with thousands of lines of code.

As the idea of cloud computing entered into a wide implementation today, data access becomes a major security issue. One of the various privacy concerns that are possibly taken into consideration relates to the maintenance of cloud data integrity. Directing users to check data integrity under public audibility is a task to be greatly considered. It is made through third party verifier who provides the client a proof whether the data placed on the server is altered or not. We proposed a dynamic data integrity checking mechanism in which the proof of correct data possession can be made from server on demand. Verifier, on behalf of the client can make a call to the server for verifying the correctness of the stored data, at anytime. This protocol is designed keeping the dynamic nature of cloud as the data placed on the server goes on changing very frequently. Thus, a dynamic data integrity approach is adopted here which includes the RSA encryption system as a method for public cryptosystem. A multiplicative homomorphic property, an idea towards integrity checking of cloud data, is implemented here. The beauty of applying and including the homomorphism property in our protocol is that, the proof can be generated by the third party verifier without having any clue of the original data. Our research is dually aimed at A) generating proof of correct data possession in a dynamic cloud environment B) providing high security of cloud data through homomorphic cryptosystem.

An exploration of the low-frequency radio window with the resolution and sensitivity essential to meet the scientific objectives will necessarily require a dedicated satellite-based interferometer operating at these frequencies. Such missions have been proposed in the literature for about the past 15 years. Today, the steady and impressive advances in technology and computing resources have brought us to the brink of a quantum jump in the performance and capabilities of such missions, increasing their scientific desirability manyfold. This paper presents the concept design which emerged from a study to investigate the feasibility of a low-frequency satellite-based interferometer operating in the frequency range 0.1\u201340 MHz titled Preparation for Radio Interferometry in Space. In place of trying to stretch and adapt the existing solutions to the requirements of very low frequency interferometry, this study attempts to tailor a design to meet its specific needs. The salient features of the design are an onboard correlator to reduce the data volumes to be transmitted to the Earth by about 2 orders of magnitude, use of three orthogonal dipoles in place of two to achieve better polarization characteristics, direct digitization of the entire radio frequency band of interest allowing broadband observations, an overlap in the observing frequency range with upcoming ground-based instruments to aid in imaging and calibration, and an all-sky imaging capability. The most constraining bottleneck for the present design is the large intraconstellation telemetry requirement. It is expected that technological solutions to meet this requirement will be found in the near future as other formation-flying missions which share this requirement emerge.", "keywords": "Radio interferometry;Radiofrequency interference;Imaging;Space vehicles;Radio astronomy;Instruments;Orbits", "doi": "10.1029/2004RS003211", "ISSN": "1944-799X", "month": "Aug"}, "155": {"type": "@ARTICLE", "id": "5710984,", "author": "F. {Stuker} and C. {Baltes} and K. {Dikaiou} and D. {Vats} and L. {Carrara} and E. {Charbon} and J. {Ripoll} and M. {Rudin", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "title": "Hybrid Small Animal Imaging System Combining Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Fluorescence Tomography Using Single Photon Avalanche Diode Detectors", "year": "2011", "volume": "30", "number": "6", "pages": "1265-1273", "abstract": "The high sensitivity of fluorescence imaging enables the detection of molecular processes in living organisms.

We classify these patterns into a series of \u201ctypes\u201d ranging from stable locked equilibria, to stable periodic oscillations, to unstable or mixed period oscillations. We observe that the stable equilibria can bifurcate to stable periodic oscillations and then to mixed period oscillations as the obstacle spacing is gradually increased. Using a 3D-reconstruction method, we experimentally characterize the robot leg-obstacle contact configurations at each step to show that the different steady patterns in robot orientation trajectories result from a self-stabilizing periodic pattern of leg-obstacle contact positions. We present a highly-simplified coupled oscillator model that predicts robot orientation pattern as a function of the leg-obstacle contact mechanism. We demonstrate that the model successfully captures the robot steady state for different obstacle spacing and robot initial conditions.

In this study, the mechanism underlying diet-induced obesity on ovarian dysfunction was studied by exposing rats to cafeteria diet (CAFD) for two different durations. For that purpose, 21-day-old female Sprague Dawley rats were fed ad libitum with a standard diet (control group) and a cafeteria diet (CAFD group) for a period of 20 weeks (20 W) and 32 weeks (32 W). We observed obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia in CAFD fed groups. Hyperinsulinemia, hypergonadotrophism, hypertestosteronemia and hyperprogesteronemia were observed in the 20 W-CAFD group. Conversely, in the 32 W-CAFD group hypersecretion declined to hyposecretion. The levels of estradiol remained low during both time periods. The duration of estrous cycle was extended in the CAFD fed rats. The ovary weight was higher in the 20 W-CAFD fed rats but it was drastically reduced over a longer duration cafeteria diet feeding. In the 20 W-CAFD fed rats, the protein levels of LHR, StAR, CYP11A1, 3\u03b2-HSD and 17\u03b2-HSD were increased but FSHR and CYP19A1 levels were decreased in the ovary. On the other hand, gonadotropin receptor and the protein levels of steroidogenic enzymes were decreased in the ovary of 32 W-CAFD fed rats. We conclude that the duration of energy-dense diet consumption has differential regulatory mechanism in altering the ovarian steroid production.

These demands call for interferometric concepts. We present here first results of our feasibility study IRASSI (Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry) for an FIR space interferometer. Extending on the principal concept of the previous study ESPRIT, it features heterodyne interferometry within a swarm of five satellite elements. The satellites can drift in and out within a range of several hundred meters, thereby achieving spatial resolutions of <0.1 arcsec over the whole wavelength range of 1\u20136 THz. Precise knowledge on the baselines will be ensured by metrology methods employing laser-based optical frequency combs, for which preliminary ground-based tests have been designed by members of our study team. We first give a motivation on how the science requirements translate into operational and design parameters for IRASSI. Our consortium has put much emphasis on the navigational aspects of such a free-flying swarm of satellites operating in relatively close vicinity. We hence present work on the formation geometry, the relative dynamics of the swarm, and aspects of our investigation towards attitude estimation. Furthermore, we discuss issues regarding the real-time capability of the autonomous relative positioning system, which is an important aspect for IRASSI where, due to the large raw data rates expected, the interferometric correlation has to be done onboard, in quasi-real-time. We also address questions regarding the spacecraft architecture and how a first thermomechanical model is used to study the effect of thermal perturbations on the spacecraft.

We examine this using Msn2 and Yap1, TFs of distinct families that contain long IDRs outside their DNA-binding domains. We find that these IDRs are both necessary and sufficient for localizing to the majority of target promoters. This IDR-directed binding does not depend on any localized domain but results from a multitude of weak determinants distributed throughout the entire IDR sequence.

Considering all human immune cell types and conditions studied, we identified cis-eQTLs for a total of 12,254 unique genes, which represent 61% of all protein-coding genes expressed in these cell types. Strikingly, a large fraction (41%) of these genes showed a strong cis-association with genotype only in a single cell type.

Here, we evaluated the effect of oral and parenteral iron therapy on bone transcriptome, bone histology and morphometry in two mouse models of juvenile CKD (adenine-induced and 5/6-nephrectomy). Both modalities of iron therapy effectively improved anemia in the mice with CKD, and lowered bone Fgf23 expression. At the same time, iron therapy suppressed genes implicated in bone formation and resulted in the loss of cortical and trabecular bone in the mice with CKD. Bone resorption was activated in untreated CKD, but iron therapy had no additional effect on this. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between biomarkers of bone turnover and iron status in a cohort of children with CKD. Children treated with iron had lower levels of circulating biomarkers of bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and the amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen), as well as fewer circulating osteoblast precursors, compared to children not treated with iron. These differences were independent of age, sex, and glomerular filtration rate. Thus, iron therapy adversely affected bone health in juvenile mice with CKD and was associated with low levels of bone formation biomarkers in children with CKD.\""}, "175": {"type": "@article", "id": "SANTAGUIDA2017638", "title": "\"Chromosome Mis-segregation Generates Cell-Cycle-Arrested Cells with Complex Karyotypes that Are Eliminated by the Immune System\"", "journal": "\"Developmental Cell\"", "volume": "\"41\"", "number": "\"6\"", "pages": "\"638 - 651.e5\"", "year": "\"2017\"", "issn": "\"1534-5807\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2017.05.022\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580717304306\"", "author": "\"Stefano Santaguida and Amelia Richardson and Divya Ramalingam Iyer and Ons M'Saad and Lauren Zasadil and Kristin A.

Previous work has identified differences in the response of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to cognate antigen based on the environment in which the antigen is presented. Thus, we hypothesized that programming of antigen specific CD8+ T cells responding to graft and pathogen may be dissimilar. Here we find that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells primed by a skin graft contract faster than those primed by gammaherpesvirus (gHV), yet are able to expand more rapidly upon rechallenge. Moreover, graft-primed antigen-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited higher frequencies of cells secreting IL-2 and demonstrate lower expression of KLRG-1, which are qualities suggestive of increased recall potential. Additionally, the expression of CD127 at a memory time point suggests graft-elicited CD8+ antigen specific T cells are maintained in a less terminally-differentiated state compared to gHV-elicited CD8+ antigen specific T cells, despite fewer cells being present at that time point. Taken together, our findings suggest that the surface marker expression and functional profiles of T cells depends on the priming conditions and may be used to predict immunologic risk following transplantation after traditional allosensitization or heterologous immune priming.\""}, "188": {"type": "@article", "id": "SINGH2020106916", "title": "\"Interplay of regional oceanography and biogeochemistry on phytoplankton bloom development in an Arctic fjord\"", "journal": "\"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science\"", "volume": "\"243\"", "pages": "\"106916\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "issn": "\"0272-7714\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106916\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419311345\"", "author": "\"Archana Singh and Divya {David T.} and Sarat C.

We monitored physical and biogeochemical variables in the fjord between July 2015 and July 2016 using Indian Arctic subsurface mooring in Kongsfjorden. The year-round records of nitrate represent the first reported sensor-based observation in the region. Here, we used the high-resolution time-series of chlorophyll a, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, photosynthetically active radiation, turbidity, temperature, and salinity to study their interactions and assess how do they relate to the development of phytoplankton bloom. Results indicated a high nitrate concentration (up to 13.3\u00a0\u03bcM) and near-zero chlorophyll a in winter. The spring bloom was spotted from mid-April to the first week of June (up to 7.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L chlorophyll a at 25\u00a0m), however, with discontinuities due to high winds events. The chlorophyll a was negatively correlated with nitrate (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Further, we observed temperature, salinity, and density characteristic of Atlantic water at 25\u00a0m and 35\u00a0m in autumn and early-winter, which coincided with nitrate peaks. This indicated nitrate supply by Atlantic inflow during the non-bloom period. We say that the features of the bloom start evolving from rather quiescent autumn and winter before it reaches an active state in spring-summer. Year-round high-resolution observations are crucial to study phytoplankton bloom phenology as any shift or change in the phenology will affect higher trophic levels and biogeochemical cycles.\""}, "189": {"type": "@article", "id": "ESHLEMAN20191422", "title": "\"Comprehensive Profiling of HIV Antibody Evolution\"", "journal": "\"Cell Reports\"", "volume": "\"27\"", "number": "\"5\"", "pages": "\"1422 - 1433.e4\"", "year": "\"2019\"", "issn": "\"2211-1247\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.097\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112471930436X\"", "author": "\"Susan H.

Since metabolic disorders are multifactorial, poly-herbal medications, and drug-herbal combination are in demand. Therefore, the present work is focused on the combinatorial renoprotective effect of rutin and ramipril on alloxan induced DN in experimental rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups, group I-control, group II-diabetic rats, group III-diabetic rats treated with ramipril, group IV-diabetic rats treated with rutin, group V-diabetic rats treated with ramipril and rutin for a period of six weeks. Results revealed administration of alloxan induced hyperglycemia and alteration in antioxidant profile. However, combination of a bioflavonoid with an Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administration restored the antioxidant status in experimental DN rats. Over-expression of ACE, TGF-\u03b21 and decreased podocin expression in diabetic rats was significantly reversed in rats administered with both ramipril and rutin. In addition to attentuating oxidative stress and fibrosis, combinatorial therapy significantly down-regulated endoplasmic reticulum stress markers GRP78 and CHOP. Notably, combination of both ramipril and rutin in low doses reduced the side effects than the administration of monotherapy alone. Histopathological results revealed that combinatorial therapy was associated with a reduction in tubulointerstitial injury.

Here we discovered that the uncharacterized human protein ZUFSP (zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase domain protein/C6orf113/ZUP1), which has been annotated as a potentially inactive UFM1 protease, and its fission yeast homolog Mug105 define a previously unrecognized class of evolutionarily conserved cysteine protease DUBs. Human ZUFSP selectively interacts with and cleaves long K63-linked poly-Ub chains by means of tandem Ub-binding domains, whereas it displays poor activity toward mono- or di-Ub substrates. In cells, ZUFSP is recruited to and regulates K63-Ub conjugates at genotoxic stress sites, promoting chromosome stability upon replication stress in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity. Our findings establish ZUFSP as a new type of linkage-selective cysteine peptidase DUB with a role in genome maintenance pathways.\""}, "196": {"type": "@article", "id": "PATEL2012146", "title": "\"Increased expression of bHLH transcription factor E2A (TCF3) in prostate cancer promotes proliferation and confers resistance to doxorubicin induced apoptosis\"", "journal": "\"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\"", "volume": "\"422\"", "number": "\"1\"", "pages": "\"146 - 151\"", "year": "\"2012\"", "issn": "\"0006-291X\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.126\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X1200808X\"", "author": "\"Divya Patel and Jaideep Chaudhary\"", "keywords": "\"Prostate, Cancer, bHLH, E2A, TCF3\"", "abstract": "\"E2A (TCF3) is a multifunctional basic helix loop helix (bHLH), transcription factor. E2A regulates transcription of target genes by homo- or heterodimerization with cell specific bHLH proteins. In general, E2A promotes cell differentiation, acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in normal cells and cancer cell lines and is required for normal B-cell development. Given the diverse biological pathways regulated/influenced by E2A little is known about its expression in cancer. In this study we investigated the expression of E2A in prostate cancer. Unexpectedly, E2A immuno-histochemistry demonstrated increased E2A expression in prostate cancer as compared to normal prostate. Silencing of E2A in prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC3 led to a significant reduction in proliferation due to G1 arrest that was in part mediated by increased CDKN1A(p21) and decreased Id1, Id3 and c-myc. E2A silencing in prostate cancer cell lines also resulted in increased apoptosis due to increased mitochondrial permeability and caspase 3/7 activation. Moreover, silencing of E2A increased sensitivity to doxorubicin induced apoptosis. Based on our results, we propose that E2A could be an upstream regulator of Id1 and c-Myc which are highly expressed in prostate cancer. These results for the first time demonstrate that E2A could in fact acts as a tumor promoter at least in prostate cancer.\""}, "197": {"type": "@article", "id": "BRIGNANI2020684", "title": "\"Remotely Produced and Axon-Derived Netrin-1 Instructs GABAergic Neuron Migration and Dopaminergic Substantia Nigra Development\"", "journal": "\"Neuron\"", "volume": "\"107\"", "number": "\"4\"", "pages": "\"684 - 702.e9\"", "year": "\"2020\"", "issn": "\"0896-6273\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.05.037\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320304062\"", "author": "\"Sara Brignani and Divya D.A.

Despite progress in identifying mDA neuron subtypes, how these neuronal subsets develop and organize into functional brain structures remains poorly understood. Here we generate and use an intersectional genetic platform, Pitx3-ITC, to dissect the mechanisms of substantia nigra (SN) development and implicate the guidance molecule Netrin-1 in the migration and positioning of mDA neuron subtypes in the SN. Unexpectedly, we show that Netrin-1, produced in the forebrain and provided to the midbrain through axon projections, instructs the migration of GABAergic neurons into the ventral SN. This migration is required to confine mDA neurons to the dorsal SN. These data demonstrate that neuron migration can be controlled by remotely produced and axon-derived secreted guidance cues, a principle that is likely to apply more generally.\""}, "198": {"type": "@article", "id": "ASGHARPOUR2016579", "title": "\"A diet-induced animal model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular cancer\"", "journal": "\"Journal of Hepatology\"", "volume": "\"65\"", "number": "\"3\"", "pages": "\"579 - 588\"", "year": "\"2016\"", "issn": "\"0168-8278\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2016.05.005\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827816301908\"", "author": "\"Amon Asgharpour and Sophie C.

They sequentially also developed steatosis (4\u20138weeks), steatohepatitis (16\u201324weeks), progressive fibrosis (16weeks onwards) and spontaneous hepatocellular cancer (HCC). There was a strong concordance between the pattern of pathway activation at a transcriptomic level between humans and mice with similar histological phenotypes (FDR 0.02 for early and 0.08 for late time points). Lipogenic, inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways activated in human NASH were also activated in these mice. The HCC gene signature resembled the S1 and S2 human subclasses of HCC (FDR 0.01 for both). Only the B6/129 mouse but not the parent strains recapitulated all of these aspects of human NAFLD.ConclusionsWe here describe a diet-induced animal model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the key physiological, metabolic, histologic, transcriptomic and cell-signaling changes seen in humans with progressive NASH.Lay summaryWe have developed a diet-induced mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic cancers in a cross between two mouse strains (129S1/SvImJ and C57Bl/6J). This model mimics all the physiological, metabolic, histological, transcriptomic gene signature and clinical endpoints of human NASH and can facilitate preclinical development of therapeutic targets for NASH.\""}, "199": {"type": "@article", "id": "SHARMA20131", "title": "\"Structural basis of the binding of fatty acids to peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP-S through second binding site\"", "journal": "\"Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics\"", "volume": "\"529\"", "number": "\"1\"", "pages": "\"1 - 10\"", "year": "\"2013\"", "issn": "\"0003-9861\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2012.11.001\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986112003840\"", "author": "\"Pradeep Sharma and Shavait Yamini and Divya Dube and Amar Singh and Gorakh Mal and Nisha Pandey and Mau Sinha and Abhay Kumar Singh and Sharmistha Dey and Punit Kaur and Dipendra K.

PGRP-S from Camelus dromedarius (CPGRP-S) has been shown to bind to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN). Its structure consists of four molecules A, B, C and D with ligand binding clefts situated at A\u2013B and C\u2013D contacts. It has been shown that LPS, LTA and PGN bind to CPGRP-S at C\u2013D contact. The cleft at the A\u2013B contact indicated features that suggested a possible binding of fatty acids including mycolic acid of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, binding studies of CPGRP-S were carried out with fatty acids, butyric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, stearic acid and mycolic acid which showed affinities in the range of 10\u22125 to 10\u22128M. Structure determinations of the complexes of CPGRP-S with above fatty acids showed that they bound to CPGRP-S in the cleft at the A\u2013B contact. The flow cytometric studies showed that mycolic acid induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 by CD3+ T cells. The concentrations of cytokines increased considerably with increasing concentrations of mycolic acid. However, their levels decreased substantially on adding CPGRP-S.\""}, "200": {"type": "@article", "id": "WONG2018730", "title": "\"Cancelled operations: a 7-day cohort study of planned adult inpatient surgery in 245 UK National Health Service hospitals\"", "journal": "\"British Journal of Anaesthesia\"", "volume": "\"121\"", "number": "\"4\"", "pages": "\"730 - 738\"", "year": "\"2018\"", "issn": "\"0007-0912\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.07.002\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091218305658\"", "author": "\"D.J.N.

resource utilisation, operating room management, surgery\"", "abstract": "\"BackgroundCancellation of planned surgery impacts substantially on patients and health systems. This study describes the incidence and reasons for cancellation of inpatient surgery in the UK NHS.MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study over 7 consecutive days in March 2017 in 245 NHS hospitals. Occurrences and reasons for previous surgical cancellations were recorded. Using multilevel logistic regression, we identified patient- and hospital-level factors associated with cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity.ResultsWe analysed data from 14 936 patients undergoing planned surgery. A total of 1499 patients (10.0%) reported previous cancellation for the same procedure; contemporaneous hospital census data indicated that 13.9% patients attending inpatient operations were cancelled on the day of surgery. Non-clinical reasons, predominantly inadequate bed capacity, accounted for a large proportion of previous cancellations. Independent risk factors for cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity included requirement for postoperative critical care [odds ratio (OR)=2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.12\u20134.02; P<0.001] and the presence of an emergency department in the treating hospital (OR=4.18; 95% CI, 2.22\u20137.89; P<0.001). Patients undergoing cancer surgery (OR=0.32; 95% CI, 0.22\u20130.46; P<0.001), obstetric procedures (OR=0.17; 95% CI, 0.08\u20130.32; P<0.001), and expedited surgery (OR=0.39; 95% CI, 0.27\u20130.56; P<0.001) were less likely to be cancelled.ConclusionsA significant proportion of patients presenting for surgery have experienced a previous cancellation for the same procedure. Cancer surgery is relatively protected, but bed capacity, including postoperative critical care requirements, are significant risk factors for previous cancellations.\""}, "201": {"type": "@article", "id": "SURENDRAN2015357", "title": "\"Air quality simulation over South Asia using Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution version-2 (HTAP-v2) emission inventory and Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART-4)\"", "journal": "\"Atmospheric Environment\"", "volume": "\"122\"", "pages": "\"357 - 372\"", "year": "\"2015\"", "issn": "\"1352-2310\"", "doi": "\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.08.023\"", "url": "\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015302685\"", "author": "\"Divya E.

The model systematically overestimates surface O3 mixing ratios (range of mean bias about: 1\u201330\u00a0ppbv) at different ground-based measurement sites in India.

The simulated seasonal variation in surface CO mixing ratio is consistent with the surface observations, but has a negative bias of about 50\u2013200\u00a0ppb which can be attributed to a large part to the coarse model resolution.

A proteomic screen identified the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M isoform 2 (Pkm2) as a partner of proinflammatory Hdac7 in murine macrophages. Myeloid-specific Hdac7 overexpression in transgenic mice amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible lactate and promotes a glycolysis-associated inflammatory signature. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic targeting of Hdac7 and other class IIa HDACs attenuates LPS-inducible glycolysis and accompanying inflammatory responses in macrophages. We show that an Hdac7-Pkm2 complex acts as an immunometabolism signaling hub, whereby Pkm2 deacetylation at lysine 433 licenses its proinflammatory functions. Disrupting this complex suppresses inflammatory responses in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.

Increased levels of dCTP diminish the effective levels of gemcitabine through molecular competition.
