As the idea of cloud computing entered into a wide implementation today, data access becomes a major security issue. One of the various privacy concerns that are possibly taken into consideration relates to the maintenance of cloud data integrity. Directing users to check data integrity under public audibility is a task to be greatly considered. It is made through third party verifier who provides the client a proof whether the data placed on the server is altered or not. We proposed a dynamic data integrity checking mechanism in which the proof of correct data possession can be made from server on demand. Verifier, on behalf of the client can make a call to the server for verifying the correctness of the stored data, at anytime. This protocol is designed keeping the dynamic nature of cloud as the data placed on the server goes on changing very frequently. Thus, a dynamic data integrity approach is adopted here which includes the RSA encryption system as a method for public cryptosystem. A multiplicative homomorphic property, an idea towards integrity checking of cloud data, is implemented here. The beauty of applying and including the homomorphism property in our protocol is that, the proof can be generated by the third party verifier without having any clue of the original data. Our research is dually aimed at A) generating proof of correct data possession in a dynamic cloud environment B) providing high security of cloud data through homomorphic cryptosystem. The proposed technique is implemented in a very productive and cost effective manner. The testing results of the proposed work are propitious and favorable.", "keywords": "cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data integrity;public key cryptography;proof generation;third party verifier;multiplicative homomorphic property;public cryptosystem;RSA encryption system;stored data correctness verification;server on demand;correct data possession proof;dynamic data integrity checking mechanism;climacteric cloud computing infrastructure;homomorphic cryptosystem;cloud data;coherent dynamic remote integrity check;Servers;Cloud computing;Protocols;Educational institutions;Ciphers;cloud computing;integrity checking;homomorphism;verifier;data possesion;RSA cryptosystem;dynamic cloud data", "doi": "10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2014.6949264", "ISSN": "", "month": "Sep."}, "1": {"type": "@INPROCEEDINGS", "id": "8738596,", "author": "Y. {Wadadekar} and L.

VANETs are useful for providing information amid vehicles because it is not necessary that drivers are aware during the time of driving. It is very difficult to implement an expeditious routing protocol amid vehicles due to propellant features of vehicular environment. The nodes which are used in VANETs have rattling advanced mobility. To reach the final destination, there are plenty of challenges for routing the packets.

However, such an integration introduces severe security risks to the vehicle. The in-vehicle network was originally designed to operate in a closed environment and thus, security was not of concern. It has now become an important issue due to an increasing number of external interfaces to the in-vehicle network. Several studies have already shown that an in-vehicle network can be easily compromised just by connecting cheap commercial devices and doing reverse engineering. Although research efforts have been made to secure in-vehicle networks, most of them focused on defining security requirements, or presenting attack scenarios without providing any feasible solution. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any study with a specific focus on understanding and analyzing the security aspects of integrating mobile devices with cars.

An exploration of the low-frequency radio window with the resolution and sensitivity essential to meet the scientific objectives will necessarily require a dedicated satellite-based interferometer operating at these frequencies. Such missions have been proposed in the literature for about the past 15 years. Today, the steady and impressive advances in technology and computing resources have brought us to the brink of a quantum jump in the performance and capabilities of such missions, increasing their scientific desirability manyfold. This paper presents the concept design which emerged from a study to investigate the feasibility of a low-frequency satellite-based interferometer operating in the frequency range 0.1\u201340 MHz titled Preparation for Radio Interferometry in Space. In place of trying to stretch and adapt the existing solutions to the requirements of very low frequency interferometry, this study attempts to tailor a design to meet its specific needs. The salient features of the design are an onboard correlator to reduce the data volumes to be transmitted to the Earth by about 2 orders of magnitude, use of three orthogonal dipoles in place of two to achieve better polarization characteristics, direct digitization of the entire radio frequency band of interest allowing broadband observations, an overlap in the observing frequency range with upcoming ground-based instruments to aid in imaging and calibration, and an all-sky imaging capability.

We classify these patterns into a series of \u201ctypes\u201d ranging from stable locked equilibria, to stable periodic oscillations, to unstable or mixed period oscillations. We observe that the stable equilibria can bifurcate to stable periodic oscillations and then to mixed period oscillations as the obstacle spacing is gradually increased. Using a 3D-reconstruction method, we experimentally characterize the robot leg-obstacle contact configurations at each step to show that the different steady patterns in robot orientation trajectories result from a self-stabilizing periodic pattern of leg-obstacle contact positions. We present a highly-simplified coupled oscillator model that predicts robot orientation pattern as a function of the leg-obstacle contact mechanism. We demonstrate that the model successfully captures the robot steady state for different obstacle spacing and robot initial conditions.
