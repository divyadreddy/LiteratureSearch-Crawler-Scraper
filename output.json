With the available information each Digital Image Processing application has to analyze, classify and recognize the objects appropriately. Pre-processing, Image segmentation, feature extraction and classification are the most common steps to follow for Classification of Images. In this study we applied various existing edge detection methods like Robert, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Otsu and Laplacian of Guassian to crab images. From the conducted analysis of all edge detection operators, it is observed that Sobel, Prewitt, Robert operators are ideal for enhancement. The paper proposes Enhanced Sobel operator, Enhanced Prewitt operator and Enhanced Robert operator using morphological operations and masking. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it gives thick edges to the crab images and removes spurious edges with help of m-connectivity. Parameters which measure the accuracy of the results are employed to compare the existing edge detection operators with proposed edge detection operators. This approach shows better results than existing edge detection operators.", "keywords": "edge detection;feature extraction;image classification;image enhancement;image segmentation;object recognition;Enhanced Image edge detection methods;crab species identification;aspiring research areas;Industrial applications demand Image;biological applications demand Image;sample images;image data;Image segmentation;crab images;conducted analysis;Robert operators;Sobel operator;spurious edges;automatic image analysis;image classification;digital image processing application;enhanced robert operator;enhanced prewitt operator;automatic object recognition;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Laplace equations;Security;Communication networks;Morphological operations;Thresholding (Imaging);Image Segmentation Methods;Robert Operator;Prewitt Operator;Sobel operators;Otsu Segmentation;Canny Edge Detection;Edge Detection operators;Laplacian of Gaussian", "doi": "10.1109/ICSNS.2018.8573629", "ISSN": "", "month": "Feb"}, "1": {"type": "@INPROCEEDINGS", "id": "6892715,", "author": "Padmavathy A.P.} and  {Solaiyammal M.} and  {Raghuvaran C.} and  {Ganesh Madhan M.", "booktitle": "2014 International Conference on Electronics and Communication Systems (ICECS)", "title": "Microstrip antenna design for UWB applications using finite ground plane approach", "year": "2014", "volume": "", "number": "", "pages": "1-4", "abstract": "This paper reports the design of a Microstrip patch antenna for the first band of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) frequency range of 3.1-3.6 GHz.

Applications that involve heavy I/O activities, which are common in the cloud, probably benefit the most from caching. The use of local volatile memory as cache might be a natural alternative, but many well-known restrictions, such as capacity and the utilization of host machines, hinder its effective use. We present the cache as a service (CaaS) model as an optional service to typical infrastructure service offerings. Specifically, the cloud provider sets aside a large pool of memory that can be dynamically partitioned and allocated to standard infrastructure services as disk cache. We first investigate the feasibility of providing CaaS with the proof-of-concept elastic cache system (using dedicated remote memory servers) built and validated on the actual system, and practical benefits of CaaS for both users and providers (i.e., performance and profit, respectively) are thoroughly studied with a novel pricing scheme. Our CaaS model helps to leverage the cloud economy greatly in that 1) the extra user cost for I/O performance gain is minimal if ever exists, and 2) the provider's profit increases due to improvements in server consolidation resulting from that performance gain.

This dichroic subreflector is designed to be used in ground station antenna for simultaneous reception of data in S and X band from remote sensing satellites. This earth station antenna consists of X band feed at Cassegrain focus which necessitates a subreflector surface to be fully reflective in (8.0-8.5)GHz and S band feed at prime focus that requires subreflector to be transparent in (2.0- 2.3)GHz. The desired performance is achieved by placing two layers of dielectric sheets printed with copper rings and keeping an inter layer spacing of \u03bb/4.

Any damage on the solar panel's surface lead to reduced production of power loss in the yield. Defects are caused by mechanical & chemical natural factors stressing the panel operating in field, such as snow, sun, wind and severe cold. Further stress factors are based on the thermal cycles of the cells involving contracting, expanding solder and wire interconnects. In this case, identification of defects in the solar panel is essential to be performed to obtain a product of high quality. Already so many methods are available to find the defect, but in any event non-contact, nondestructive and efficient testing methods are necessary. This project proposes an automated inspection system based on a Bluetooth for solar panel application in order to detect any minute cracks which may be appeared on the surface of solar panel. The power value has been calculated based on the current value updated from the current sensor to user by using Bluetooth. The sensor updates status of the solar panels through the android mobile using Bluetooth. This operation is based on the embedded systems. Each solar cell in the panels is connected to individual current sensors. The sensor output is connected to the microcontroller through ADC. When there is a crack in the cell then its output will become low. The microcontroller estimates the current sensor output to the threshold value. If the value is less than threshold then the microcontroller indicates that to the Android mobile through the Bluetooth. The user can monitor current and power level. The Bluetooth is more safe and sustainable for power level and it has to collect the output in wireless mode for more efficiency and security.", "keywords": "building integrated photovoltaics;computerised instrumentation;crack detection;electric current measurement;electric sensing devices;fault diagnosis;inspection;microcontrollers;power measurement;solar cell arrays;Bluetooth;fault detection;fault identification;solar cell panel application;electrical energy generation;power loss production;thermal cycling;solder;wire interconnection;solar panel defect identification;nondestructive testing method;automated inspection system;embedded systems;microcontroller;ADC;Android mobile;crack detection;Solar panels;Photovoltaic cells;Embedded systems;Bluetooth;Imaging;Solar panels;Bluetooth;Renewable energy", "doi": "10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8390096", "ISSN": "", "month": "Aug"}, "73": {"type": "@INPROCEEDINGS", "id": "8959976,", "author": "P. {Padmavathi} and S. {Natarajan", "booktitle": "2019 Innovations in Power and Advanced Computing Technologies (i-PACT)", "title": "A Novel Switched Capacitor based High Gain Boost Converter with efficient MPPT controller for LED Lighting Applications", "year": "2019", "volume": "1", "number": "", "pages": "1-7", "abstract": "The paper proposed a novel switched capacitor based high gain quadratic DC-DC boost converter with Perturb & Observe MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) controller.

Agent based technology has hailed as a new paradigm for implementing software agents. Software agents are autonomous entities which act on behalf of user across open and distributed environments. A Multi Agent System for cloud service composition makes use of a market-oriented approach which would regulate demand and supply chain.

The consumer agent gets the input from the user and finds the best service providers who satisfy the consumer's constraints. Consumer agent further establishes a negotiation between these service providers and purchases the cloud services for market favorable cost. The consumer and service provider agents communicate using Contract Net Protocol, which is a task-sharing protocol in multi-agent system.

Available Transfer Capability (ATC) is what exactly the allowable power limit to accommodate new users without violating the commitments of the existing users. Thus in the deregulated environment, this transfer capability is of more concern. ATC is a dependent factor on the system thermal, stability and voltage limits. With the introduction of FACTS devices, the line overloads, bus voltage problems are considerably brought down.

DLP is the basis for many public key cryptosystems. The ephemeral keys are used in such systems to ensure the security. The DLP defined on a prime field Zp* of random prime is considered in the present study. The most effective method to solve the DLP is the Index Calculus Method. In the present study, an efficient way of computing the DLP for ephemeral key by using a new variant of ICM when the factors of p-1 are known and small is proposed. The ICM has two steps, such as a pre-computation and an individual logarithm computation. The pre-computation step is to compute the logarithms of a subset of a group and the individual logarithm step is to find the DLP using the pre-computed logarithms. Since the ephemeral keys are dynamic and changes for every session, once the logarithms of a subset of a group is known, the DLP for the ephemeral key can be obtained using the individual logarithm step. Therefore, an efficient way of solving the individual logarithm step based on the newly proposed pre-computation method is presented and the performance is analyzed on a comprehensive set of experiments. The ephemeral keys are also solved by using other methods, which are efficient on random primes, such as Pohlig-Hellman, Var-Oorschot method and traditional individual logarithm step.

It is a novel approach designed for optimized channel use and improved power consumption efficiency. PA-STDMA performs transmission scheduling based on positional information of individual nodes. This facilitates on-line topology transparent transmission scheduling and scalability. For optimized bandwidth use, the protocol integrates transmission scheduling with contention. PA-STDMA provides power efficient operation as a result of its efficient channel arbitration and intelligent use of low power mode. EnDRop is another mechanism for energy saving and timely delivery of data packets is incorporated into the route discovery phase to select paths with lower cost. The proposed algorithm utilizes two metrics: residual energy and queue length at each node. Buffer information is considered as a traffic load characteristic and its use is two fold: limitation of battery power consumption and end-to-end delay.

The results of the simulations are compared to results obtained from simulations of the IEEE 802.11 MAC under the same conditions.

Most current rs-fMRI analyses use linear correlation. Since correlation is a bivariate measure of association, it discards most of the information contained in the spatial variation of the thousands of hemodynamic signals within the voxels in a given brain region. Subject-specific functional RSNs using typical rs-fMRI data, are therefore dominated by indirect connections and loss of spatial information and can only deliver reliable connectivity after group averaging. While bivariate partial correlation can rule out indirect connections, it results in connectivity that is too sparse due to lack of sensitivity. We have developed a method that uses all the spatial variation information in a given parcel by employing a multivariate information-theoretic association measure based on canonical correlations. Our method, multivariate conditional mutual information (mvCMI) reliably constructs single-subject connectivity estimates showing mostly direct connections. Averaging across subjects is not needed. The method is applied to Human Connectome Project data and compared to diffusion MRI.

Hence, in this paper, an algorithm is developed to count the number of hops between the transmitting node and the receiving node considering for all probable topologies of a only connected static network.

Inaccuracy in the estimation of SpO2 may prevail due to the motion artifacts (MA) corruption in the detected PPG signals by the intentional or unintentional movements of a patient. The MA noise corruption is unavoidable while recording the PPG's because of a very small pulsatile component in PPG (0.1% of total signal amplitude) and it can be reduced by suitable processing of the PPG signals. In this paper, an approach for motion artifact (MA) reduction of photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals based on the concept of dual-tree complex wavelet transform technique is proposed.

MA corruption due to voluntary or involuntary movements of patient, while recording the photoplethysmographic (PPG) data using pulse oximeter, is the main source of error in the estimation of arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). In this paper, for addressing the issue of MA reduction in recorded PPG data, the physical origins of PPG signals are explored and complex empirical mode decomposition (CEMD) adaptive filter is proposed. The novelty of the proposed filtering method lies in the fact that instead of using additional hardware for acquisition of noise reference signal, representing MA noise, for adaptive filtering process, is generated internally from the MA corrupted PPG signal using CEMD technique. The generated noise reference signal is then applied to the adaptive step-size least mean squares (AS-LMS) algorithm for artifact removal. The merit of the proposed filtering method is proved by comparing it with Daubechies wavelet transform (Db10) based MA reduction method for the PPG data recorded with different MA (Horizontal, Vertical and Bending motion of finger).

That means anyone could share information in any form with any other person residing anywhere in the earth. With the availability of information and communication technology like cloud computing, heterogeneous networking, crowd sensing, web services and data mining, anywhere and anytime information sharing is possible, but this will bring out lot of challenges like incompatibility in standards, data portability, data aggregation, data dissemination, differential context and communication overhead. The ICT has changed many aspects of human lifestyle, work places and living spaces. However, there is one sector namely agriculture which has been deprived of the real advantages of ICT. Hence, there exists a digital divide between farming industry and other industries. Farming industry consumes large amount of natural resources such as water, energy and fertilizers that could escalate issues such as global warming, soil degradation and depletion of ground water to the next level. To reduce the global warming effect, farming industry needs to be integrated with relevant technologies. This paper proposes ubiquitous context oriented middleware architecture for precision agriculture (LA-COMPa) to solve major issues such as waste of water, improper application of fertilizer, choice of wrong crops and season, poor yield and lack of marketing.", "keywords": "agricultural engineering;crops;fertilisers;global warming;learning (artificial intelligence);middleware;natural resources;soil;ubiquitous computing;learning automaton based context oriented middleware architecture;precision agriculture;living landscape;digital village;information and communication technology;cloud computing;heterogeneous networking;crowd sensing;Web services;data mining;information sharing;data portability;data aggregation;data dissemination;ICT;human lifestyle;work places;living spaces;natural resources;global warming;soil degradation;ground water depletion;global warming effect;farming industry;LA-COMPa;fertilizer;crops;marketing;Context;Learning automata;Middleware;Fertilizers;Manuals;Soil", "doi": "10.1109/CITS.2015.7297720", "ISSN": "", "month": "July"}, "171": {"type": "@INPROCEEDINGS", "id": "6229395,", "author": "E.

For addressing the issue of MA reduction in pulse oximetry applications, the physical origins of PPG signals are to be explored and effective signal processing technique may be employed. In this paper, we propose simple and efficient empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) for MA reduction in PPG signals. EMD is relatively a new time-frequency analysis technique having wide range of applications. EMD uses HHT calculation to handle non-linear and non-stationary data to find the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and analyze the variations in power spectrum over time. The efficacy of the proposed method is proved by comparing it with well known wavelet transform based MA reduction method for the PPG data recorded with different MA (Horizontal, Vertical and Bending motion of finger).

The motion artifacts (MA) in PPGs not only make SpO2 estimations unreliable and inaccurate but also make it difficult to extract respiratory information. Addressing this issue, for the first time, we propose a novel approach called \u201cICA-based improved dual-tree complex wavelet transform (I2DTCWT)\u201d technique, for efficient reduction of MAs leaving the respiratory information undisturbed. The method makes use of source separation ability of independent component analysis (ICA) along with computationally efficient modified DTCWT processing. A prototype pulse oximeter was developed and performance analysis of DTCWT, modified DTCWT and I2DTCWT processing methods was carried out using PPG data recorded with intentionally created MAs (horizontal MA, vertical MA, and bending MA). Experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of DTCWT processing methods in restoring PPG morphology and proved that there is a significant improvement guaranteed in reducing MAs with the presented methods. Statistical performance is evaluated in terms of measures like signal-to-noise ratio, normalized root mean square error, and correlation analysis with correlation co-efficient measure. The I2DTCWT outperformed other DTCWT processing methods in respect of MA reduction and the computed spectra revealed that safe extraction of respiratory information is guaranteed from these MA reduced PPGs. The proposed method is also validated by comparing with the well established signal extraction technology of MASIMO pulse oximeters, for which the discrete saturation transform (DST) is the key element. The %SpO2 estimations from processed PPGs by the proposed method closely followed the estimations based on DST and were very close to that of clean sections of PPG. In addition, the proposed method resulted in less computation cost compared to the MASIMO SET. Digital volume pulse waveform contour analysis is also performed on MA reduced PPGs to validate PPG morphology and the conventional parameters are calculated for assessing the arterial stiffness.", "keywords": "correlation methods;independent component analysis;medical signal processing;photoplethysmography;wavelet transforms;ICA;DTCWT technique;MA reduction;PPG signal;restored respiratory information;arterial blood oxygen saturation;pulse oximeter signal;photoplethysmographic signal;motion artifact reduction;dual tree complex wavelet transform;source separation;independent component analysis;statistical performance;signal-to-noise ratio;normalized root mean square error;correlation analysis;correlation coefficient measure;respiratory information safe extraction;digital volume pulse waveform contour analysis;PPG morphology;Noise;Estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Blood;Discrete wavelet transforms;Arterial blood oxygen saturation $({\\rm SpO}_2)$;conventional DTCWT;ICA-based improved DTCWT $({\\rm I}^2{\\rm DTCWT})$;modified DTCWT;motion artifacts;PPG;pulse oximeter", "doi": "10.1109/TIM.2013.2259114", "ISSN": "1557-9662", "month": "Oct"}}
