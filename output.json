A star shaped structure is realized by combining triangular shaped planar monopole patch with its inverted configuration. A detailed parametric study of the offset placement of two triangular shaped patches with respect to the patch centroids, variation in distance between the base of composite structure and the ground plane, is presented. To further improve impedance matching composite structure is chopped at the lower vertex point and a parametric study for the offset feed positions is carried out. The proposed antenna yields an optimum bandwidth of more than 8 GHz ranging from less than 2 GHz to more than 10 GHz with a broadside co-polar gain of around 1 to 2 dBi over a complete bandwidth.", "keywords": "monopole antennas;planar antennas;ultra wideband antennas;impedance matching composite structure;triangular shaped planar monopole patch;star shaped structure;ultrawideband star shaped planar monopole antenna;Resonant frequency;Impedance matching;Feeds;Ultra wideband antennas;Impedance;Microstrip;Ultra-wideband antenna;Planar monopole antenna;Triangular planar monopole antenna;Inverted triangular planar monopole antenna;Star shaped planar monopole patch", "doi": "10.1109/ANTS.2016.7947838", "ISSN": "", "month": "Nov"}, "1": {"type": "@INPROCEEDINGS", "id": "9038527,", "author": "D. {Kirshnan} and  {Nasimuddin} and A. {Alphones} and M. {Sun", "booktitle": "2019 IEEE Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference (APMC)", "title": "Enhanced Frequency Tuning based on Optimized Liquid Crystal Cavity based Patch Antenna", "year": "2019", "volume": "", "number": "", "pages": "1545-1547", "abstract": "This paper investigates optimization of embedded liquid crystal cavity in the patch antenna ground plane at Ka-band to get the largest frequency tuning across the Ka-band.

The impact on the voltage profile of the system has been assessed when the induction motor uses star and delta configured stator connections. The voltage profile study is being extended for improvement with the employment of permanently connected capacitors across stator windings.

Despite significant efforts to prepare for operational implementation of new IFPs, the process does not always go smoothly. The primary goal of this study was to understand what makes IFPs difficult from the perspective of line pilots. We spoke to 45 professional pilots in small groups. The pilots reviewed, briefed, and discussed six IFPs in an office setting. We extracted a comprehensive list of subjective complexity factors by observing pilot briefings and gathering pilot feedback. Then we organized the list into a framework that captures a variety of types of complexity. We define a subjective complexity factor as one that requires an extra mental or physical step by the pilot. IFP design parameters (e.g., the number of transitions and flight path constraints) are a main driver for subjective complexity for line pilots. Unusual IFP designs can result in novel chart depictions that are unfamiliar and more difficult to use. In turn, novel chart formats may have inconsistencies that increase subjective complexity. Participants also mentioned factors that are outside the control of IFP designers, such as weather, fatigue, and aircraft performance or equipment. We separate out these as operational complexity factors. The broad nature of the pilot interviews also provided insights into how pilots use charts today, in the context of the modern flight deck. A full report on the study is in preparation.", "keywords": "aerospace navigation;air traffic control;air traffic control;operational complexity factors;subjective complexity factor;pilot feedback;IFPs;instrument flight procedures;PBN;performance based navigation;terminal instrument flight procedure complexity;line pilot perspectives;Complexity theory;Aircraft;Instruments;Navigation;Safety;Interviews;Aerospace electronics;aeronautical charts;instrument flight procedures;IFP;SID;STAR;RNAV;RNP;PBN", "doi": "10.1109/DASC.2016.7778012", "ISSN": "2155-7209", "month": "Sep."}}
